:: BookStore [storage outOfHouse nobr mall] {"position":"2300,1625","size":"100,100"}
The aroma of fresh coffee and dog-eared books, combined with warm, earthy colors, makes this coffee shop-cum-bookstore immediately inviting and welcoming. Filled with wooden furniture and plants, complimented by smooth jazz playing in the background, the vibe of the Coffee Corner makes you feel right at home.

<<if $gameDate.getHours() <= 20 and $gameDate.getHours() >= 12>>Behind the counters, stands a rather disinterested punk girl.

You could either sit down with some coffee and enjoy a book, or browse the ones they have for sale.
