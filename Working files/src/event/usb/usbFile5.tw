You got the password, you got the file, let's see what this baby holds! It's another log file or something, just a small part of a bigger whole, but you think you can still get some good information from it.  It also seems a lot older, looking at the file information. At from a few years ago...

<<Dialogue "toshiUnknown" "Toshi">>
Okay, okay, so some of the gene-unlockers got misplaced. This is bad. I really gotta start being more careful with my distillations as I seem to have lost two. Why did I even take them outside?!? One of them I had to have lost yesterday. I already retraced all my steps, I think. I went back to the library, to the museum, the gym... even the community garden. I asked everyone I saw in those places, even the cute Italian girl. She was so shy I had to dig the answers out of her.

The problem was too that this was a more refined version; it was a gene-unlocker with several distillations, all combined. It was meant to be diluted, and now a full bottle of that is out there, somewhere! Unless someone has drunk it already. Argh, I havenâ€™t even had a chance to test this myself, and now it might hurt someone!
