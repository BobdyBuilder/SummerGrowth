You quickly find the small tear by the arm hole. Armed with your trusty line and needle, you start fixing the fabric before it gives you any more trouble.<br><br>Elena watches from afar, intently.

She’s been looking at your fingers for a good three minutes now - in fact, when she tried to return the dumbbells, she just piled them precariously on top of other dumbbells, an accident waiting to happen.<br><br>You finish your little project, raising it up for inspection before giving a proud smile and putting it back on. You warn Elena about her dumbbell snafu, and she blushes before hurriedly putting the weights away properly.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Do you… I mean, would you mind… would it a problem… maybe, you think you could… fix and alter some clothes… for me?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><span id="choice"><<link "Of course, it really is no biggie!">><<replace "#choice">><<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure!

In fact, you wonder how many clothes she has that she can wear outside of the gym, as even her trademark tan gym leotard seems to be one deep breath away from snapping like a slingshot.<br><br>Elena seems to have a lot of questions regarding the logistics of the process, but is still a smidge too shy to bother you about it right now. You agree to meet her later to get the clothes, but forget to ask for an opportunity to get her measurements so you can work on it.<br><br>As you think about it, you realize you might just need to get a bigger measuring tape…<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>><</replace>><</link>><<link "That seems a bit intimidating…">><<replace "#choice">>You start to think about what her wardrobe looks like, then you imagine the amount of clothes she must have overgrown - worse yet, by just HOW MUCH she has overgrown them.

You could swear you even hear a small gasp coming from your partner as you finish your set with enviable form.<br><br><<else>>You grab the bar and start the set, and Elena steps in briefly, placing her hands on your body to make slight corrections to your form. You try not to get distracted, but her hands feel so good, so gentle…<br><br>Snap out of it, <<print $playerFirstName>>! You continue, making mental notes of Elena’s corrections, trying to be very aware of your body for future workouts.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Molto bene//. You are a quick learner.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><</if>>After you finish, it’s Elena’s turn. You stand behind her as a spotter, and watch her gracefully bend down and pick up the weight. She moves with the grace of a dancer, but the determination of a lion. You watch her perfect form, her gaze intently fixed on the mirror doing the same. She keeps completing rep after rep as if all were the very first, like she doesn’t get tired. You don’t know what true beauty is, but it could very well be this. Despite her size, Elena somehow makes this motion feel almost… poetic. Like a machine that was engineered specifically for aesthetic beauty in its purposeful cycle.<br><br>After she is finished, you are still somewhat stunned.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Bambina//, you are up.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You shake your head awake, and return to the weight. <<if $shyConfident < 0>>You feel a little awkward now, Elena is a tough act to follow. You grab the weight, but now looking self-consciously at the mirror. You start your second set of deadlifts, but you’ve gotten into your head and can’t really concentrate.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"<<print $playerFirstName>>... are you alright?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your form is wobbly and wonky. You try to fix one problem and create another two. Your movements are janky and erratic. And it’s not the load, it’s your head that’s getting in the way.<br><br>Elena comes in behind you gently, and grabs the weight with an underhand grip. Together, the two of you continue, and the feeling of her skin against yours somehow makes your worries melt away. You resume your previous, much improved, form… and all is good in the world. By the time you notice, Elena has already stepped back and you are finishing your set. She claps, congratulating you, and you blush deeply.<<elseif $shyConfident > 1>>You want to impress Elena, and end up adding even more weight to the bar. She questions your decision politely, but you insist. You grab the bar, but now your reps are not nearly as nice as last time, waving and shaking all the way. Elena just steps back, giving you more space, but clearly prepared to step in if something happens.<br><br>After you are done, you realize this was a bad idea, and just remove the excess weight, feeling slightly ashamed.<</if>>Done with your set, it’s Elena’s turn again. She goes for the bar, and it is no surprise that it’s a reprise of the last set: fluid and precise. You admire her every motion and every <<if $measurementSystem == \"metric\">>centimeter<<else>>inch<</if>> of her body… until you look at her through the mirror, and your eyes meet.<br><br>It feels like a spark flying between the two of you, literal electricity running through your spine. And the feeling seems to be mutual, as Elena gasps and her grip loosens, her form shaking from that simple gaze. Faster than your brain can process, you have stepped in behind her, in a hug, grabbing the weight as your bodies meet.<br><br>Elena feels very warm to touch, but also surprisingly soft for someone so muscular. And instead of jerking back at the touch, she just closes her eyes, and resumes the exercise, humming contently.<br><br>You remain there, holding the weight - and her indirectly - as the set comes to completion. You take a silent step back, and she turns around, her usual shy expression slightly melted into… a very warm (but still shy) smile.<<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Grazie//, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Thank you… for the spot.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Ah, it was nothing…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You lie.<br><br>Each one of you continue for another set, as if nothing had happened. But it did. And you can’t shake the feeling that Elena might just be opening up to you a bit.'

It breaks your heart. So you sit down on the white side, and move a pawn. Elena looks at you very surprised, then smiles broadly as she makes her own move.<br><br> Elena’s game is impressive, if not downright scary. Going against your expectations, she takes almost no time before making her moves, showing zero sign of hesitation. But she has an incredible awareness of the board and seems to be able to look more moves ahead than you could ever dream of.

You apologize, and let her make her original move - which clinches another checkmate for her.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That… was beautiful…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, no… that was just fortuna… luck.<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I didn’t mean the play…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say, as you gaze admiringly into her eyes.

She puts her hand on yours, and says with incredible sweetness:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie…."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<else>> Elena starts to pull her hand back, but you hold it in yours. Yes, her hand is calloused from handling obscene amounts of weight on a daily basis… and yet… it feels so soft. But you can also feel she is shaking a bit, and as you see the anxiety in her eyes, you let go. <</if>> Looking at her phone, Elena realizes what time it is, and gets up in a hurry.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"È tardi… I should go…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> She grabs her belongings and starts walking off, but she turns to you one last time.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"We should do this again.

        content: `You watch your form as you perform some truly challenging hero curls, admiring your arms, while you notice a couple of dudes hunched over their phones, snort and laughing at the corner. You’ve actually been quite amused by some gym memes you saw at your apartment earlier, and figure you might join in on the fun. You carefully release the handles, one at a time, and go check on the joke that is making the two people so amused.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Ohhh, make it one of those boomerang videos, and add a caption like… I know! “I drink steroids for breakfast!” That’s going to get a ton of likes."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"It might just beat the one where we said we didn’t know they allowed elephants at the gym!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Confused, you discreetly approach from behind, trying to get a look at what they have on their screen. You find out that they are posting Picstagram stories of Elena, which they apparently have been filming without her knowledge.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"What if we make one teasing her for confusing the term muscle pump and make a joke about her using an air pump instead?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"Hmmm… too convoluted, maybe we just compare her to a balloon or something? I’m sure we can make a video of her taking a deep breath while benching, she wouldn’t even notice…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"OHHH! I think you are on to something - she looks extra-freaky when she does that. We might just break the 10k likes from last time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Your blood starts boiling. Elena is already shy and makes a point to only come to the gym late at night because she doesn’t want others seeing her… and here these two are making viral memes making fun of her? It’s a good thing Elena doesn’t really hang out on social media that much - if she knew about this, she might stop getting out of her house entirely!<br><br> The thing is, the more the two talk and laugh, the harder your fists tighten and your jaw clenches. You find yourself on the verge of cracking your teeth, so much you are gritting them. Your breath is heavy, and you frankly wouldn’t be surprised if you turned green and bulked out like that comic character - you are THAT angry.<br><br> You take a deep breath, because you are seriously a hair away from seeing red and just bulldozing everything in front of you. You make a mental note of how strong you are, and that comes with certain responsibilities - it could be pretty disastrous if you REALLY lost your temper. But you care deeply about Elena, and you realize you’d go the distance to protect her from this cruel world… still… deep sigh, <<print $playerFirstName>>.<br><br> <span id="choice"> <<link "This will not stand, I need to teach them a serious lesson.">> <<replace "#choice">> You tap one of the guys on the shoulder. Without looking at you, he waves off, saying they are busy now. You crack your knuckles, which makes quite a loud noise, and finally catches their attention properly. <<if $height >= 185>>Your shadow completely engulfs them, reinforcing just how much bigger you are. <</if>>As they turn, they freeze for a second as they fully realize how dwarfed they are by you, despite both being serious gym-goers.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear you talking about my friend."<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two stammer, locking the phone and hiding it behind their backs. <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Uh, us? No, we… we were just… looking at some funny memes."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You crack your knuckles a second time for impact. They both gulp.<br><br> <<if $muscle >= 85>> Without taking your eyes off them, you reach to the side and grab a barbell.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, is that so? Because I value privacy AND my friends. I might get REALLY upset if someone were to film my friends without permission - let alone make fun of them."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You start putting pressure on the barbell. Your traps, arms, chest and lats flare, making you look even bigger - like a cobra preparing to strike.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It makes me angry. And when I get angry… I sometimes lose control."<</Dialogue>><br><br> The metal rod creaks in your hands, as it starts slowly bending. The two take a half-step back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You see… my friend doesn’t always take the initiative to defend herself, so I need to be EXTRA vigilant of her. Which is why I make sure I’m strong enough to take care of her. In fact, I make sure I’m STRONGER than her."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You fully twist the barbell in half, and let a strong gust of air from your nose, like a boar ready to strike. That makes the two guys jump. You toss the bent barbell to them, and the two fumble and almost let the heavy twisted bar fall.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So you better HOPE I don’t find a single video or picture of her online when I get home later tonight… or I might get REALLY angry. Is that clear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1>> You look at them, and reach for their phone. They try to stop you from getting it, but they don’t have much of a choice against your incredible might.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really? Then I want to see it too. Why don’t you unlock it and share, then?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They look at each other, quickly panicking. They stammer, trying to come up with excuses, but failing to even articulate a proper sentence.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come ON! I really want to see the funny memes! If I’m not amused… I may have to find some fun in trying to figure out if I can crack a smartphone with just one hand!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You start tensing your hand, and the poor device seems to slightly bend before you even put any real effort. The owner of the device just unlocks it before you do any real damage, and you can see the video of Elena with a funny caption on Picstagram.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, so THAT is what you find funny? Big, muscular girls are a joke to you, is that it? I don’t think I get it, could you explain, please?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Their faces get drained of all blood as they experience terror from your mass and dominance. You step closer, enough for them to feel the heat radiating from your sweaty body.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? Aren’t buff girls funny? Why aren’t you laughing, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You return the phone to the guy.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I am giving you 10 seconds to delete that account, any posts of my friend you have on social media… and God help you if I find another image of her online. Do I make myself CLEAR?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He almost drops the phone as he rushes back to his Picstagram control panel, as his friend apologizes profusely. You tell them to NEVER come back to the gym at night, or there will be consequences. <<elseif $shyConfident > 1>> You grab your own phone, and switch the camera to selfie mode. You start recording a Picstagram account of yourself flexing, showing the two guys in the background. Loudly, you start narrating during your video:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Still laughing at people who say I’m strong for a GIRL… I can’t believe there are dorks like those guys who think that a gym is a place to put people down on social media. Can you imagine those WIMPS judging people?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You focus on them over your enormous arms, making them look pretty pitiful - even if they are in decent shape. You give one of them a wedgie, still recording, lifting the guy by the trunk clear off the ground. You show them the video you just made.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Huh, what do you know, making fun of people on social media IS funny. Maybe I should post this and tag you two… maybe you guys want to armwrestle me and post that two? Wouldn’t that be a hoot?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They stammer, trying to come up with an answer, and you can see the terror in their faces as they realize the humiliation they could endure if this went live.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"OOOOOOOR… we could agree that shaming people on social media is dumb, and you delete your account right now and pray I never find ANY pictures or videos of my friend being made fun of, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I’m not one for violence, but I am really protective of my friend. You don’t want me reporting your account for harassment, right? Can we all just agree that it’s dumb? Now delete that before I show what my anti-bullying stance is in detail, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <</if>> The two nod, and run away trying to quickly delete their Picstagram account. You hope that Elena never gets to see that, knowing how much it would hurt her. How can people be so mean? While part of you wishes that Elena would stand up for herself, you can’t help but appreciate her innocence and peaceful nature even more. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Maybe I just need to explain that Elena is shy and they should refrain from doing that, they’ll understand.">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, you two. Yeah, you."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They look at you, confused.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"GEEEEEEEZ LOUISE! Are they just giving steroids as a sign-in bonus for girls at this gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Haha. Did anyone ever tell you two are really funny? No? Why am I not surprised?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two snort with more laughs, and you roll your eyes.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Alright, fun time is over now. I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and ASSUME you two aren’t aware, but Elena is actually very shy and sensitive, and it would really hurt her if she found out people are making fun of her size online."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Well, duh, why wouldn’t they? The girl is a freak - and apparently, so are her friends, damn!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You wince, and give a very angry smile. Control yourself, <<print $playerFirstName>>, it’s just some teen guys who don’t know better, let’s make them grow as people, right?<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, how would you feel if someone made fun of you wearing a sleeveless top thinking your arms are somehow worth showing off?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"DAAAAAYUMMMM! You just got SERVED, dude!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And YOU are one to talk? I’ve heard about skipping leg day, but the chicken coop called, they wanted their drumsticks back."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They both get silent and awkward, as you give them both a playful but strong tap on the back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See, now imagine me posting our little conversation online to all your friends, and random people on the Internet. Not so much fun, right? And Elena happens to be very shy on top of that."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They seem divided about the whole thing - they clearly know the clout they got from their viral videos, but they apparently had never been on the receiving end of the bullying.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"She means quite a lot to me, so I will insist that you delete anything you already posted about her, and refrain from taking any more footage of her without permission. How about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You can see the pair isn’t sure how to proceed. Your point clearly came across, but they are very used to just shaming others online for clout. So… you figure you might just have to get down to their level after how.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Tell you what - why don’t we armwrestle for it? If you win - you can keep the videos live. BUT if I win, you have to take her stuff down and post the video of me beating you… in fact, I’m willing to take on both of you at once!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They are intrigued by the proposal, but quickly realize there’s a very real chance that you could probably take the two of them down… and how much fun they would be made of online.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"I GUESS we could take it all down. I suppose we were mean doing it in the first place…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"THAT’S what I wanted to hear!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You tap both of them on the head, and watch as they remove the videos. You hope they learned their lesson, and will be more mindful of other people’s feelings in the future when trying to go viral… or… well, you might just have to feature them on your own Picstagram in the future after all! <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… excuse me, but I think you guys are making fun of my friend on social media?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They turn to see who is talking to them, and are quite surprised to see another mammoth girl.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"GEEEEEEEZ LOUISE! Are they just giving steroids as a sign-in bonus for girls at this gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You blush a bit, sighing in frustration but decide to stand your ground.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I just don’t think that’s nice, alright? She’s pretty shy and she would be devastated if she found out people are making fun of her online."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Well, who is she to complain about devastation? I bet she leaves a trail of destruction wherever she goes!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You feel your anger welling more and more. You close your eyes and take another deep breath.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m just asking nicely, please, don’t make fun of her, she already has a complex about her body, it would REALLY hurt her, OK?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"Why shouldn’t she? A freak like that really should have some issues - and I’m not just talking about breaking chairs wherever she goes!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You bite your tongue as you wince, taking yet another deep breath. Your heart is now racing. Your knuckles are turning white from squeezing them so much.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"All I am saying is, can you be mindful of her feelings? I’m sure there are other cool viral things you can post for social clout."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"I dunno, man! Not even sure she HAS feelings. I’m pretty sure a train could hit her and she wouldn’t even notice…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Without thinking, your anger takes over and you punch the concrete wall to your side, cracking it. The impact also makes one of the weight racks tumbles. The two guys experience pure terror at your display of rage and strength, and immediately go speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I really am asking nicely. Could you just DELETE those posts RIGHT NOW?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> It takes a few seconds for them to unfreeze from the shock, but they go and delete the whole account right before your eyes.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And, again, nicely, please refrain from ever filming her without permission? In fact, why don’t you make that a general rule, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They nod in agreement, and walk back without facing away from you. You take a deep breath of relief, your introverted side gasping for air after this weird incident. You check your hand, which is bruised and slightly cut from the impact. Still, you look at the cracked concrete, kind of amazed at your own strength. But even that fades away as you think of poor Elena, unaware of this horribly bullying. You pray she never finds out about these videos, as you know it would probably be devastating. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> </span>`

I… I noticed."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Even when she’s blushing, she’s so adorable!<br><br><<else>>You are embarrassed to admit your posterior postural procedural problem. You blush a bit, and reply:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I… guess the day hasn’t been very conducive for bench pressing, is all."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Elena, smarter than she might appear, picks up on it immediately.<br><br><</if>><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"If I may… I’ve had my share of problems with la meccanica… of being… you know… a growing girl trying to lift."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You tilt your head. You’d never given this any thought, but given her age, she probably made her gains really fast, not unlike you. But even though she’s very careful and precise at the gym, it must have taken quite a bit of trial and error to get proper form while exercising given her… wide frame.<br><br>She motions silently for you to get up, and brings the incline bench under your quite immovable barbell rack. She timidly eyes your entire body, then dutifully changes the inclination on the bench, and stands behind the barbell, to hand it to you at the increased height.<br><br>You try laying down again, resting your tush at the uninclined portion of the bench. The small inclination for your back, however, makes up the difference for your gigantic glutes perfectly. You arch your back tentatively, and it feels just like you are just laying down as you used to.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, Elena, this is perfect! Thank you so much!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The young girl giggles, covering her mouth, before handing you the almost curving loaded barbell, which she spots while you bench. You can see the delight in her smile… if only you had known it was so easy to make her happy like this, you would have struggled at the gym earlier!`

But this time you step in it feeling a lot less confident or pleased… you hold the USB drive in your hand, and as you spot Elena, she flashes her usual shy smile back at you. Instead of warming you up inside, however, this time, it makes you anxious.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Elena, how are you doing?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            The giant girl wipes the sweat on her forehead with a towel, her well-developed chest still heaving from the effort she was putting herself into. Her shy smile quickly fades, as her highly empathetic nature picks up on your nervousness, and you can see her mirroring your feeling almost instantly.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I’m… fine, <<print $playerFirstName>>. What’s wrong?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Preferring to skip right to the chase, you open your palm, revealing the data device.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena… I… need some help."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She looks at the small plastic piece on your hand, slightly confused, but puts a hand on your shoulder as she replies:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Anything… just… talk to me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You feel the warmth of her hand, not unlike the sensation her caring eyes give you. You bite your lip and just let it out.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I… need to know more about the potions. I came across this at Tasha’s - this USB drive belonged to Connor, the person I believe made all these concoctions."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena winces at the mention of the name - and you feel her hand grip your shoulder harder than she would have probably liked. Her eyes start darting around a bit.
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"The files in here, I’m positive they are all related to these experiments. And I need to understand these changes that are happening to me… they are rapturous bliss just as they are terrifying… I NEED to know more about this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I… think I know what you mean…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            This clearly isn’t an easy subject for her, but you can feel her internal struggle, her own questions that she has repressed for so long, also trying to break free.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I can’t pretend to know what it was like for you, Elena. But I know that for me this still feels like a curse and a blessing in disguise, and I keep struggling with that. It’s the uncertainties that preclude me from truly becoming this person that I feel like I was always meant to be, you know? I need to understand, so I can finally be myself."<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
            In a flash, Elena’s usual insecurity completely vanishes, and that determination that always was always hinted underneath comes to the forefront. Her hunched posture gives place to her full height and poise.
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You will never be alone in this, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Those chemicals scare me… but I suppose I can’t just keep running away from it, either. La paura… The fear, it’s been controlling me for too long. It’s time I face it."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You are in awe. Was this beautiful, confident woman always hiding inside the hunched, insecure muscular girl? You hug Elena tightly, as you whisper a faint “thank you” in her ear. She closes her eyes and passes a gentle hand on your hair as she shushes and promises that everything will be fine.<br><br>
            After this surreal moment, you recompose yourself, and see Elena circling back to her natural state.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well… so… we still need to find a way to crack these passwords…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Ecco. Do you have any suggerimenti… any clues or hints?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Not really. I’ve basically been accidentally stumbling upon these weird metal vials, and they do stuff to me. Not only that, but I feel like everything I do is naturally amplified… there’s this weird action and reaction dynamic I can’t quite explain. Well, that, and it always hits me hardest when I wake up."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena nods in agreement, and you can feel like she knows exactly what you are talking about.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"It was a big deal when Connor was expelled. I still have some of the giornale… the newspaper clippings. I’ll see if I can find anything."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You know this won’t be easy for her, which makes you appreciate the effort even more. You thank her again, before changing the subject:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So how about we lift some obscene amount of iron now? I could use a little distraction!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena giggles, and you join her in a gruesome but very fulfilling session of strength training.`

        content: `You try to focus and finish your current set, but it’s hard. Every time you are about to get in the groove, you get flashbacks of that picture those meatheads posted of Elena online. It just sours your mood and breaks your concentration. That sparkling joy of the effort with the weights just dissolved into thin air every time your eyes cross with the gentle giant, who seems to be in a world of her own across the gym.<br><br>
            It weighs heavy on your heart - it feels like this world does not deserve her. And you worry how random cruelty might hurt her at any point.<br><br>
            I mean, there’s no denying that people are just wired to make judgement on first visual impressions - you’ve felt this yourself, both when you were a small underdeveloped girl... and now. It can be dehumanizing, and you just know Elena is much more sensitive than you. Ugh!<br><br>
            You blink rapidly, trying to put these thoughts aside, but it feels like they aren’t going anywhere. You decide to get a break from pumping iron and checking if Elena is willing to talk for a bit.<br><br>
            <<if $shyConfident > 1 ||  $carefreeCarefull < -1>>
            You tap Elena on the shoulder, and just blurt it out without thinking much.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Elena, there’s something bothering me, can we just chat for a bit?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena jumps like she got shocked from your touch, dropping the heavy barbell, which makes the floor shake considerably.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"EEEK! Oh, <<print $playerFirstName>>, //scuzi//, you scared me there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Despite being slightly embarrassed, her sweet smile shows no sign of resentment, but then it transitions into some worry as she fully processes your request.
            <<else>>
            You wait patiently as Elena finishes her set, her concentration absolutely unwavering, like always. As she puts the barbell down and wipes her forehead with a deep breath, you approach her from the side with a calm wave. It brings a weak but sincere smile to her introspective visage - it blooms like a flower in spring, and warms you just as much.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, hi, Elena... if you have a second for a break at some point, huh... there’s something bothering me, when you can, I’d love to chat for a bit, maybe?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Concern sprouts on her face almost immediately. You know just how selfless Elena can be, and she’d probably jump in front of a speeding truck to save you without thinking twice, so it’s only natural that she’d drop anything with just an insinuation of trouble.<br><br>
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Certamente!//"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She follows you to the smoothie bar, where you both try to comically get comfortable on the small stools - and end up just leaning against the counter (probably discouraging any other gymgoer of using the facilities). You take a deep breath, and start venting.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena, I’m just going to cut to the chase. Those guys who were making fun of you and took your picture? It really bothered me, you know? "<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena looks somewhat puzzled. She frowns and her neck slightly bends forward.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, they were just assholes, but it got me thinking, this stuff gets to you, right? How do you handle people just judging you by your appearance? It seems to me like it really bothers you. But I can only imagine it really affects your daily life. Constantly!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena’s worry seems to chill a bit, and she smiles while looking into your eyes.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//È vero, suppongo che// the way I look is something I get quite… //come si dice,// uh, self-conscious, about my... size."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You feel a stab in your chest as she says the S-word, you can tell it almost requires effort to get it through her throat, like trying to cough up a ball.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I AM afraid that people are going to look at me and just see the monster. Oh, sometimes //mi chiedo//... I wonder... would it be worse if people WANTED that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Elena’s eyes focus on the distance, and she’s clearly very pensive, almost like she’s talking more to herself than you.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Is it even still me, if I change so much? Am I making a mistake by working out, even if it helps me feel good? It IS quite a relief that I’m not growing like I did when this started - that was //terrificante//."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You put a hand on her shoulder, and Elena seems to snap from her little monologue. But she looks you deep in your eyes, and says, quite happily:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"<<if $elenaMuseumDate>>//Mi fiore,//<<else>>//Cara mia,//<</if>>, you are right, //mi infastidire//, it bothers me, but... not as much as my concern about YOU worrying about me. So, the best help I can get is... not worrying you. Does that even make sense?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            More than you can imagine, Elena. More than you can imagine!<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Absolutely! There are days, Elena, that I feel like there’s someone pulling my strings like a puppet, that I do completely contradictory things, and I’m not sure of who I am deep inside..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            “Though guzzling all those weird potions willy-nilly probably isn’t helping,” you think to yourself, knowing that saying it out loud would probably bother her.<br><br>
            Elena smiles, and as usual, she brightens the entire room with it.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I think the best part about our //amizicia//, our friendship, is that I feel safe with you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<if $shyConfident < 2 || $carefreeCarefull >1 >>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It goes both ways, Elena. I don’t have that many close friends in this new town, but sometimes I feel like I’ve known you forever."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She looks surprised, as she mumbles:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//mi hai tolto le parole di bocca.//"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<else>>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, who wouldn’t, being with someone with THESE CANNONS?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You deliver your best mock-bodybuilder pose, making your sinewy arms and back explode while you make funny faces. Elena just raises an eyebrow, and her expression SCREAMS “really?”
            <</if>><br><br>
            Well, it seems like your concern is solved. Elena is a big girl (in more ways than one), and you realize that, despite her sensitive nature, she can probably more than take care of herself. Getting up, you offer her a hand, and she follows you back to the weights, both eager to finish your respective training sessions.`
