You grab your phone and almost call Elena, but decide to text her instead to avoid any unnecessary anxiety.<br><br>
You try to keep it casual and ask if she wants to do something later, to which she replies:<br><br>
ELENA: How about dinner at my house later tonight?<br><br>
Whoa, Nelly! That escalated quickly, but works perfectly for your secret plan. It will take some planning, but you think it should be manageable. <<if $skills[1].level > 3>><<set $flag.elenaMadePasta to true>>You offer to bring some homemade pasta, to which Elena responds promptly:<br><br>
ELENA: Perfetto! Iâ€™ll make some tomato sauce using vegetables from my garden.<br><br>
Wow, this is getting better and better by the minute!
<</if>><br><br>
And so you make a note to go visit Elena tonight after 7pm. Looking forward to it!
