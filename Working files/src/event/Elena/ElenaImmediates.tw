Glistening sweat is pouring off her tanned skin, while her brown bangs curtain her face a bit, resting just above her huge pecs. With absolute focus, she keeps repeating the motion, seemingly unaware of anything around her. Yet, despite her size, everything about her gives you this dainty vibe: the sounds she makes, being secluded in a corner, and maintaining this slouched posture, almost as if she was willingly trying to miniaturize herself. It is all at odds with her enormous frame. Carefully approaching her, you grab some weights and started lifting by her side, hoping for a chance to engage in some small talk.<br><br><span id="choice"><<link " Damn you\'re gigantic!">><<replace "#choice">><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Damn girl, what have they been feeding you?!

Even your breath seems to require more energy, but your body feels like a power plant, your massive shape almost incongruent with your reserves of stamina. Your oversized hand takes a firm grasp of the biggest weights you can find, lifting slowly and graciously, respecting the grind that you eagerly look forward to. With that, your workout begins, pumping iron while maintaining proper form carefully, catching eyes here and there from ongoing gym members, including one in particular that hadn’t noticed you before. As the exercise continues, the fire in your body are kindled, along with heaps of muscle mass expanding due to excitement and use. Each pump is counted, calculated, and executed to the best of your ability, resulting in yet another amazing workout. <br><br>Before you know it, time flew beyond your ken, as two hours already passed. With your body feeling undeniable fatigue, you still crave for more. The used weights were slowly laid to rest, dripping with about as much sweat as your face. The corded muscles on your rugged back pulled and flexed, craning your torso upward, eyes scanning the environment like a predator ready to pounce. It was then that you envisioned your physique through the mirror, you newly-found gains a joy to behold. And yet, a massive dark figure stood above you, eyes beaming down at your every move. As your mind registers the interloper, a loud gasp fills your lungs as you nearly leap back from your seat. <br><br>A quiet squeak was reciprocated, with just as much shock, and the unexpected hunk scurries back a little bit, trying to hide its face behind rather dainty hands and flexed pecs. Once the initial shock has passed, you finally find it in yourself to stand up properly, turning to find the shy giant actually hasn’t fled, and despite her unmatched stature, her legs shake from fear. For something so wobbly, those legs still seem solid like adult trees. <br><br>As you approach her, she seems to tentatively lower her hands, revealing sparkling honey-colored eyes completely trained on you, all of you. Soon, a blush follows. It takes a few moments, but your eyebrows eventually furl with the realization of what just transpired.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Hey, it\'s you again."<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> "!!!..."<</Dialogue>><br>Her surprise at such a statement causes her pecs to contract involuntarily, shifting her entire posture, and even with her tan skin, her blush somehow becomes even redder. It only takes a moment for her to turn back and rush to the women’s lockers. This time, you can tell something different has happened. Just before she disappeared around the corner, she briefly turned to look back, eyes meeting yours in what seemed to be the most eager yet hesitant invite one could muster. Without a moment’s notice, you trail off after the caramel giant, intrigued to confirm if she finally has something to say to you.<br><br>Once you had arrive in the locker room, there she stood, still partially covering herself from sheer embarrassment, but now cornered, nowhere left to run. You approached slowly, as if trying to reassure a scared wild animal, which is the exact energy she is exuding. Before her expression grows too concerned, you stop in your tracks, standing a firm six paces away from this mountain of woman.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Hey, there.” <</Dialogue>><br>Perhaps this time she might respond. The warm curiosity in your voice seems to finally reassure her, almost like she was expecting screaming or disdain instead. Slowly, she lowers her gigantic arms to reveal her vulnerable expression, still besmirched by that deep blush. <br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “H-hello…” <</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “It’s nice to meet you, finally. I’ve been a bit curious ever since we first spoke… er, tried to, at least. My name is <<print $playerFirstName>>. What about you?”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “Oh! //S-scuzi//. //Sono// Elena. I mean, I’m Elena.”<</Dialogue>><br>She seems conflicted, scared beyond belief to even open herself this much, and yet eager to show herself to you. Subtlety wasn’t exactly her strong suit, though, considering her muscles constantly flex and bulge beyond her control, suggesting suppressed intent. You try not to avoid excessive eye contact to make her more at ease. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Wow, that’s a pretty name. I really like it!”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “O-oh, thank you. It is Italian. //S-sono italiana//.”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “I see.”<</Dialogue>><br>You don’t really know anything of the language, perhaps just the name of a few typical dishes. But somehow her meaning seems to easily surface from her empathetic nature. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “So, I’ve been meaning to ask, seeing as, well, you\'re about my size, maybe… you’d want to work out together? We kinda fell off the bell curve, so I think it might be nice to help each other.”<</Dialogue>><br>Her eyes widen in sheer disbelief of her ears. <br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “I’ve been meaning to ask you the same thing!”<</Dialogue>><br>She blurted it out finally, revealing what she’d apparently been wanting to do all this time.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “I… really admire how big you are, and I couldn’t keep myself from looking. So… I… would love… to… work out with… you…”<</Dialogue>><br>Although poor Elena seems to struggle to keep it together, you nod, trying to meet her halfway in her contained expression, but communicating that you understood her intent. You can feel her struggle, given her shy nature, it seems like a herculean task for her to open up to other people, so she must fight with loneliness quite a bit. But it seems like you were given a golden chance just now!<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Sounds like a good deal! How about I meet you here tomorrow, around the same time, huh?”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “//S-si//!”<</Dialogue>><br>With that, you muster an awkward smile before trampling away with a sense of victory. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but there are plenty of lives where that came from.<br><br><<link "You got her to open up!." "gym">><</link>>'

In fact, it goes by almost completely unnoticed, since you are both in the zone, in a mostly empty gym. Sure, other gymgoers drop big barbells all the time there – but never with enough plates to make the entire building shake. Still, the poor janitor there almost had a heart attack, wondering if that was an earthquake or an alien invasion.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>“That’s another one.”<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>“Y-yeah. It’s not as easy for some people, I… guess.”<</Dialogue>><br><br>You take a moment to catch your breath, realizing you had been going at this exercise nonstop. Your arms pulsate with the needy hunger you’ve battled with for the duration of this exciting yet grueling session. One could liken it to edging in a way, and with how proficient you’ve gotten at it, there was a bit of excitement to be had.<br><br>It seems like the moment wasn’t just yours though. Elena, your workout partner, lifts herself up with one massive crunch, her maze of abdominal muscles squished and outlined in a perfect manner, gravity bringing her massive chest to hang slightly over them. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>“Say… I don’t think I’ve ever asked, but what are your thoughts on exercising outdoors?”<</Dialogue>><br><br>The tan girl pauses for a moment, that familiar blush showing its colors.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>“O-of course!

But I try my best not to worry too much about what other people think. I just focus on the important things, the here and now.”<</Dialogue>><br><br>She slowly nods, taking a while to digest that statement, long enough for her to murmur it back to herself. Her voice is quiet as always. You allow her a moment to contemplate that, and find yourself joining her. What is important to her?<br><br>Well, working out is obviously a priority. But there must be something else you might discern given your growing intimacy with her. As these moments of golden silence mount, muffling the other gym goers grunting and groaning as they struggle with their weights, you still come up empty in the end. Come to think of it, you never really thought to ask her. With no better time than the present, you throw the proverbial line. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>“Hey, how about I take you out someday, and we spend some time discussing things that are important to us? You know, with two of us together, maybe we don’t stick out so much.”<</Dialogue>><br><br>Like a puppy being called by its owner, Elena bursts away from her thoughts, a heat wave painting her face while her brain reluctantly tries to wrap itself around your request.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>”Y-you want to… take ME out?...

    content: `As you awkwardly find a way to cross the gym’s turnstile with your mammoth thighs, you find Elena doing something unusual - not actually exercising. She’s usually pretty focused while at the gym, rarely ever dilly-dallying or interacting with others, getting to work as soon as she arrives and leaving right after she finishes - so you are quite surprised to see her in the common area of the entrance.<br><br>It’s… quite a sight. Elena is crouched in front of the notice board in the lobby - the corkboard is set to “eye level”, but the little giantess proves that this is a somewhat relative concept. She looks at one colorful flier with the same intent of a child who stands guard in front of a fireplace on Christmas Eve: her eyes gleam with a hopeful eagerness and you can hear a loud sigh as you approach her.<br><br><<if $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s up, Elena?

The notice is adorned with a big red and yellow flower you’ve never seen before, described as the “queen of orchids”.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Southeast Asian flowers, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Again, Elena sighs, her expression filled with melancholy. You tilt your head, confused - you genuinely expected her to be quite excited about the prospect of seeing these plants up close. <<if $shyConfident > 0>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? I assume you are planning to go… right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<else>>You look at her, confused. Why does she seem so sad?

You can swear she’s holding a sob inside, her breathing coming with effort.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I bambini… I scare them. I can’t bear to ruin such a magical experience as the museo for them. It was one of my favorite pastimes back in Italia, you know? I would spend hours - history, art, even lo zoo. It was always magical."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Without even noticing, your fists ball in a tight squeeze. This feels horribly wrong deep inside - Elena’s selfless sacrifice… she might be a humongous specimen, but the mere idea of anyone (or ANYTHING) being afraid of her surfaces a mix of anguish, confusion and rage in you.<br><br>Quickly, your brain decides that it is your mission to make sure she gets to see this exhibit.

Elena’s shoulders slump, making her somehow look and feel… small? That alone would be shocking, but it’s the sadness in her that really stings, penetrating your heart like a knife.<br><br>This sparks even more emotion in you, making you rip the flier off the notice board, making the thumbtack fly as you intently scan the entire document in hopes of finding SOMETHING useful. The sudden motion makes Elena step back, scared. You don’t realize how fierce you look as you do, your protective side surfacing like a tiger defending its offspring from predators - you just HAVE to find a way to make this work!<br><br>And as you flip the pamphlet over, you notice something - along the address of the museum, there’s a notice that the place has special summer hours, exceptionally opening on Monday mornings.

She turns her head sideways, trying to avoid direct eye contact, and then launches on an unexpected hunt for the lost thumbtack. Damn! You probably should have broken that subject slowly…<br><br>Elena finds the errant thumbtack, and turns her back to you as she affixes the leaflet back on the notice board. It’s taking all your self-control not to bring your palm to your forehead in frustration for your silly faux-pas with your shy companion. If only you could turn back time…<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Mi piacerebbe molto. I would love that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Wait, what?

Before you can reply, she’s off to lift weights, leaving you dumbfounded. I guess it’s really happening!

While she’s not acting downright mousey as when you first met her, she is also strangely cold. As you load huge plate after huge plate on your side of the bar, she just avoids your gaze entirely. As usual, you load the bar until it can hold no more plates, applying the fastener on that tiny bit of the rod a small nightmare, while the support rack groans under the intense cargo.

Elena is also there, changing herself by her locker, trying to sneak a peek without you noticing (and failing, those big eyes are hard to ignore!). That’s when you hear a guttural rumbling coming from somewhere?<br><br><br>You probably would have never realized what that was... if not for the fact that Elena immediately wrapped her arms around her torso and blushed in shame of the sound of her stomach. As you turn to look at her, she covers her face. It’s downright adorable.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Hungry, Elena? Can’t blame you, today we really pushed it in there!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>She shakes her head, the futility of her denial just makes it all cuter.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"Oh, //perdonami//.

I could DEFINETELY use a bite - why don’t you come over? I could cook something...\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Elena just freezes. It’s like her brain is rebooting - she’s totally immobile, you are not even sure she’s even breathing. But then, her stomach rumbles again, betraying her. In fact, you can see clear as day on her expression, she looks down at her torso almost like she’s mad at her own body. It makes you want to squish her cheeks SO BAD!<br><br><br>With a sigh, she finally relents.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Non vi mentirò, sono affamata//.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>She looks glum, almost melancholy, as she admits she actually is hungry. I mean, that’s what you assume she did from her non-verbal clues. It’s not hard to read Elena.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"So, what do you say? Wanna come over?

Still, with a smile, you two finish changing and head back to your apartment.<br><br><br><<if $elenaDate2Finished>><br>You leave the gym, and you grab Elena’s hand to show the way home. It’s only a minute later that you realize that she’s holding her breath and going almost purple in the face. You let go of her hand and give her a tap on the back, and she take a big gulp of air. She gives a nervous laugh, but looks you in the eye.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Perdonami, mi fiore//.

It makes you notice how warm her skin is - and while you sorta expected her palm to be rougher from all the lifting and garden work… it’s unbelievably soft. You make a mental note to ask what moisturizer she uses, because it seems to be doing wonders.<br><<else>><br>You actually find yourself wrapping your arm around her wide shoulders and squeezing her against your torso, and Elena’s entire body tenses - it’s kinda impressive, she simultaneously increases her size due to her flexed muscles, but also hunches over and somehow coccoons herself into a smaller, more compact frame. Like a clam, no matter the effort, you can’t seem to make her open up. Oh, well. Thankfully, your apartment isn’t so far away.<br><</if>><br><br><br><<else>><br>You walk Elena to your apartment building, with the occasional small talk. It’s still a bit crazy how insecure she seems just walking on the street, given that, well, who would mess with her? But you get it - you know well what it’s like, worrying about what people think of you. Still, you point out the starry sky and it seems to help her relax some. You don’t get to see Elena out of the gym that much, and it’s a side of her you find yourself enjoying more and more.<br><</if>><br>Elena passes the front door of the building, and seems somewhat intimidated by the dilapidated nature of the halls. At one point another apartment door creaks open, and she shields herself behind you - and you’d think she’s a small, helpless girl, not someone who could probably crack said door off its hinges without that much effort. But you try to be patient and humor her, and you direct her to the dark stairs leading underground and into your apartment.<br><br><br>As you open the door, Elena rushes in front of you, and you feel slightly bad for putting her through this. You watch as she stumbles around <<<<if $livingRoomCleaned + $kitchenCleaned + $bathRoomCleaned + bedRoomCleaned > 3>> and looks somewhat concerned at the messy rooms. Damn, you should have kept on top of your cleaning. It clearly bothers her quite a bit, but she’s WAY too polite to say anything. With a forced smile, you just bring her to the corner where you cook.<br><<else>><br>And you thank every deity you know of, and several you only recently learned about due to Johan's ramblings, that you made sure to keep the apartment clean - it would be quite embarrassing if there was a mess, and Elena would undoubtedly notice immediately, and you don’t even want to imagine what she would think of you. Still, she wanders aimlessly, apparently looking for windows unsuccessfully. You surmise she’s probably low-key claustrophobic, as you notice her nervous twitching. Still, you bring her to the admittedly cramped for two huge people kitchen.  <br><</if>><br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"You know what? Why don’t you hang out by the coffee table? I can handle dinner.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Elena seems almost offended at the concept of leaving all the work to you. She doesn’t even need to articulate it, the way she looks at you indignantly is enough for you to rethink that plan.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Actually, I could use a hand, why don’t you mince the tomatoes and garlic while prepare the potatoes for the gnocchi?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Gnocchi? Di patate?!?//\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Putting aside the fact she didn’t butcher the pronunciation of the dish name like you, Elena’s eyes twinkle like a girl who just stumbled on Santa Claus putting gifts under the tree. You smirk, knowing the lengths you went through to find the perfect recipe for the fresh pasta.<br><br><br>You heat up the potatoes you had pre-cooked earlier for ricing, and Elena grabs the knife and board and starts dicing the tomatoes for the sauce. Thanks to your strong muscles and a great ricer, the smashing of the tubers is a pretty easy task, which allows you to observe Elena’s task.<br><br><br>It still surprises you how, despite her bulk, just how delicate everything she does is. The tiny tips of her fingers folded over the tomatoes shows not only great skill, but she does it slowly and very carefully. Her concentration is impressive - she holds and watches the knife like it could bulldoze the entire building if handled incorrectly, and each slice seems to have the exact width of the previous one. You almost feel obliged to tell her that she just needs to dice it roughly for the sauce, so the cubes don’t need to be so symmetrical... but she’s so into it that you don’t have the heart to correct her.<br><br><br>But you as you stop watching her to squeeze more potatoes, Elena is now the one watching as you squeeze them into the bowl for the pasta. Her eyes widen as your arms flex, even if you don’t need to put that much effort, drawing out the definition of biceps and triceps... she’s fully mesmerized until…<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Ahia!//\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Distracted, Elena nicks her finger with the extremely sharp knife. As it starts to bleed, you drop everything you were doing and come to her. She just shakes her hand, and blushes, feeling very self-conscious and embarrassed about her mistake. Before you can think, you grab her hand to inspect the damage.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Ouch, that’s a nasty cut… I need to go grab something to clean and bandage it.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>And then, before you can think, you bring the index finger to your mouth and suck around the wound. This sends a huge shiver down Elena’s spine, and she gasps.<br><br><br><<if $elenaOpinon >= 40>><br>With her finger still in your lips, your eyes meet with hers, and you can feel the tension. But there’s something different this time - she isn’t retreating into herself. No, there’s a spark between the two of you. Instead of her eyes darting away, they are all drawn to each other like strong magnets, impossible to disconnect.<br><br><br>By the time you realize it, you are running your hand through Elena’s hair, who instead of tensing, seems to melt under your touch. You might have her finger in your mouth, but the only think in your brain right now is wondering what those full lips taste like. You bet they taste just like honey, not unlike the color of her eyes.<br><br><br>You have no idea how much time has passed, and only the bubbling boiling water overflowing breaks your trance, and as you snap, you let go of Elena’s hand.<br><<elseif $elenaOpinion >= 30>><br>Her breath becomes ragged, almost hyperventilating, and she shakes slightly. You let go of her hand, and she pulls it back. <br><</if>> <br><br><br>You run to get some antiseptic and a bandage, and very carefully you clean the cut and apply the adhesive. Neither of you can say another word, as you individually finish your tasks to cook the gnocchi. It’s kind of neat in a way, it’s almost like you have a bit of a telepathic connection and with simple signs you communicate enough to get the job done. Elena, in an unusual sign of proactiveness, sets the table beautifully. But while you each seem to intuitively know what the other is thinking, it also makes the whole situation is more awkward as both of you play a game of chicken to see who will speak first.<br><br><br>You finally serve the gnocchi to both plates, and Elena eyes it hungrily - with a last rumbling of her stomach to punctuate the occasion. It breaks the tension, and she grabs a forkful of the delicacy.<br><br><br>Once again, you thank the heavens for her transparent visage - as she brings the pasta to her lips, you can almost visibly see her shivering from head to toe, as she moans with delight. You grab yourself a mouthful as well, confirming that you nailed the meal.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"This... this is... //stupendo!// Just like //mia nonna// used to make!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Her reaction warms you up from the inside as much as the actual food. You watch as her feet shake happily each time she puts more of the pasta in her mouth. Still, being so self-aware, you didn’t expect her to get a second serving, but she does, and you are enjoying watching her eat so much that you leave half of your food get cold on the plate.<br><br><br>But all good things come to an end, and Elena sighs happily as she is satisfied. She feels so content and relaxed, and it’s almost magical to witness. But as she realizes that the rest of the world still exists, she looks at you, and something clicks, she gets slightly defensive again - but not quite as much as before.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//G-grazi!// Thank you so much, I felt like a little girl all over again.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Maybe that is what you witnessed. The little girl that Elena carries within. She is always peeking through her eyes, but it stirs that will to protect and care for her. It distracts you so much that you don’t even respond.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"<<print $playerFirstName>>?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Oh, sorry, I got distracted there for a second. That is high praise, coming from a true Italian, no less!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>     <br>You both share a happy smile, but Elena looks at the time and the anxiety gets the best of her.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Dio mio!// It’s so late! I need to go home.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br><<if $elenaOpinon >= 40>><br>She gets up and hurries to the door, but briefly stops and turns around.<br><br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"T-thank you again… not only for the food, //m-m-ma//... b-but for the bandage as well.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br><</if>><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"We should do this more often - you should try my tiramisu!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><br>Elena bites her lips, and you could almost swear she flutters off the ground when she hears the T-word. You can tell it takes almost all her willpower to say her goodbyes and leave. But it would seem like the saying about hearts and stomachs may just be spot on!<br><<set $elenaOpinion +=10>>"

But then, the unexpected happens. Elena turns her head, surprised, and smiles at the guy. You stop, dead in your tracks, as they exchange some words.

And so you get ready and grab the bus towards her house, expecting to spend the whole day on this demanding project.<br><br>
Hearing some noise on the backyard, you don’t even worry about knocking on the door: taking the route around the house, you just walk towards the clearing, finding Elena in a makeshift pair of overalls, trying to separate all the materials.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Ciao//, <<print $playerFirstName>>! Thank you again for coming."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Did you really think I’d leave you to do this by yourself? Not that I don’t think you couldn’t, just... I want to see this greenhouse built as well!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena smiles, and walks to the back porch, where she grabs a bundle of blue denim.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Here, I also got clothes for you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She hands you a pair of oversized overalls that matches hers, and a huge shirt.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I don’t want your clothes to be damaged helping me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Awwww, you didn’t have to, but that’s cute!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You head in to change, taking off your streetclothes before placing your legs into the enormous holes of the overalls. <<if $muscle >85>>Despite the large circumference, your beefy legs have to squeeze through, and the denim looks painted on given how stretched it is around the muscle. The definition of every muscle group is a reminder that you and Elena should have very little issue when it comes handling any tasks that require a lot of strength. As you pull the suspenders over your bulbous butt, you are happy that the outfil leaves your giant arms free, giving a lot of range for the hard work ahead (and frankly, who doesn’t like a good old fashioned GUN show?). Regardless, you clasp the suspenders in front <<if $breasts >80>>of your humongous tits, like they are wrapped around mountains and keeps them so taut on the way down it looks almost comical.
<<elseif $breasts >60>>of your rather oversized breasts, digging into the fatty tissue but sucessfully holding the attire up.
<<elseif $breasts >40>>of (or rather, around) your nice breasts, pushing them together in a rather visually pleasant fashion that really brings attention to your nice assets - though it could get a little uncomfortable or impractical.
<<else>>of your breasts.
<</if>> Would you look at that! This outfit is perfect to showcase your physique, and it’s impressive that it brings out the fact you are larger than your giant colleague.<br><br> 
<<elseif $muscle > 70>>You fill the legs rather nicely, as Elena seems to have picked just the perfect size (which, in an of itself, must have been a challenge as this is way bigger than anything you’d find off the rack). It does still allow your muscular physique to be clearly on display, thick legs nicely wrapped in denim, as the curves of your nice ass are also displayed as you pull the suspenders over your defined shoulders - leaving your muscular arms on full display and with free range of motion, which is a great plus. Regardless, you clasp the suspenders in front <<if $breasts >80>>of your humongous tits, like they are wrapped around mountains and keeps them so taut on the way down it looks almost comical.

<<else>>of your breasts.
<</if>>
And so you take a look at the mirror, strangely giddy about the matching outfit (and muscularity) of your friend.<br><br>
<<else>>
Elena probably had quite a lot of work to find clothes this large, and the legs are a bit oversized despite your incredibly muscular physique - which, to be fair, still lags a bit behind hers. So the denim hangs a bit like a tent around your calves and thighs (which is somewhat of a rare feeling for you these days). Still, you fish the suspenders over your shoulders, clasping it on the front. While the piece is a little baggy, it’s nice to have your guns out so at least some of your muscles can be properly displayed. Sure, it makes it clear that despite being super-buff, you still have some ways to go until you match Elena, but that’s not a bad thing.<br><br>
<</if>>
The outfit makes you feel like a real farm girl! Now all you need is a reed of grass to put on your mouth and a cowboy hat and you’d be ready for Halloween!<br><br>
Amused, you head back out, finding Elena measuring and marking the exact spot where the greenhouse will be built.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That looks pretty big!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I figured if we are doing this, might as well go ahead and plan for all my needs. Besides, I need to be able to navigate in there to tend to the flowers, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Point taken."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You watch as she carefully plants stakes on the corners, running some wire to mark where the walls will go. Alright! Now must start the hard work!
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"We need to remove about <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>25cm<<else>>10 inches<</if>> of topsoil, do you think you could dig that out while I use the lumber planer on the wood I cut?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You watch the pile of logs that were felled by your large friend, wishing you had come sooner to see her playing lumberjack - which must have been quite a sight - but nod in agreement. She shows you a very large shovel, and puts some safety googles, which look adorable on her face.<br><br>
Grabbing the shovel, you start digging out the dirt from the assigned zone, trying to guess what <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>25cm<<else>>10 inches<</if>> looks like. After taking a few scoops, you confirm the depth with the measuring tape, and get to clearing the rest properly. But before you do, you lean against the shovel and take a second to admire Elena’s task: she secured the log and grabbed a simple bladed planer and is shaving away the plank until it’s perfectly flat. The entire process is somewhat mistifying: first, she cuts the wood down to the correct size, very carefully measuring its dimensions - she gets her nose all the way to the tape, squinting, to get as precise as she can (which, given her own enormous dimensions, is both cute and unexpected). You are amazed with the ease with each she handles the extremely heavy-looking piece of lumber, shoulders and arms pumped and bulging each time she lifts and adjusts the log.<br><br>
But once she has the piece down and marked, she grabs the planer, and her eyes turn very serious, a look of complete concentration. She starts running the planer, displaying a tremendous spectacle of both power and precision as wood shaving fly off, her back and leg muscles getting the mother of all workouts as they become surfaces as rough as the wood she’s shaving, her shirt barely able to contain the flesh under those two denim suspenders.<br><br>
But you snap yourself awake with a shake of the head, and get back to digging. Truly, your task is no less physically demanding - removing this thick layer of topsoil and compacting the dirt underneath is one of the biggest workouts you’ve ever done, making the veins on your arms fully apparent, each muscle group fully pumped as sweat gives your entire physique a marvellous sheen under the rising sun. Despite enjoying the effort quite a bit, knowing that it’s making you even stronger, it is incredibly tiring work.<br><br>
A couple of hours pass, and you seem about done with your digging. You look over at Elena, and she has a pile of measure wood, properly shaved into planks. It’s a pity each took a different task, but you did get to just appreciate looking at her while you dug.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Phew, I’m done here. Do I need to do something to this big pile of dirt?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>  
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Don’t worry, I’ll use it on pots and the garden later. Right now, we have a very difficult task."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She looks a bit worried, but you are not sure why. She lays some landscaping fabric down on the hole you dug, before pointing at a huge metal container.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Now we need to place a layer of //calcare//, uh, limestone."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You look at the container, full of finger-sized pellets of limestone. She looks at it, reaching for buckets to start laying the material as the foundation for the greenhouse - but its hard filling the bucket with the large pebbles, and it would that hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of scoops to get it all there.<br><br>
<<if $muscle > 89>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me, Elena, let me handle this."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You crack your knuckles loudly, looking very serious and decided as you approach the large container. Elena’s confusion increases as you place both hands on the side of it, and she gasps as you start trying to lift it.<br><br>
Your fingers dig into the metal, deforming it to create some makeshift handles, the muscles on your arms, shoulders and back suddenly exploding as you start putting the effort to raise the incredible heavy load. Your calves and quads follow suit, huge veins dutifully pumping blood through your entire sweaty body. No, this is just too heavy, as you realize that this must weight as much as a compact car. But when you turn and see Elena’s face, looking at you in awe, something sparks inside of you. No, you can’t fail her now. Gritting your teeth, you take a very deep breath, and with a grunt, you redouble your efforts. You can feel your muscles hardening and tightening, the burning sensation spreading fast as the container trembles - and finally lifts a bit from the ground. Elena loudly yelps, making a motion to help. You turn your face to her and just shake your head dismissively, determined to do this on your own.<br><br>
You feel like a goddamn superhero, like you were lifting a bus full of children into safety. Sure, the limestone pebbles aren’t as exciting, but you genuinely feel like the strongest person on the entire planet (which, being next to Elena, is a feat on its own). You slowly slide towards the hole, and with even more effort, you tip the container sideways, raising one side and lowering the other. It’s even harder, but you manage, as the pebbles start sliding and filling the pit, covering the hole.<br><br>
In a matter of a couple of minutes, the entire surface is covered, and the now much lighter container can be put down somewhere safe. You arms look and feel so engorged you could swear they are bigger than just the usual workout pump.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>! Are you okay?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena jumps to your side, holding your absurdly huge upper arms, caressing them with worry - a mix of trying to ascertain if they are fine and massaging them affectionately. She looks at your face, <<if $shyConfident < -1>> finding you downright embarrassed and blushing - which creates a feedback loop of making her self-conscious about what she just did. She takes her hand off and her lips tighten into a thin line.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I-I’m okay, Elena. No worries. Ready for my next task!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena isn’t entirely convinced, but she certainly is awed. Deep inside, you hope that this helps her understand she doesn’t need to be embarrassed about her own muscles and strength.
<<elseif $shyConfident < 1>>
her unusual display filling your with pride as you smile back warmly at her and swear that you are doing just fine. Her puppy eyes persist, however, as she hugs your enormous arm - like a precious treasure that could just vanish at a moment’s notice. You put a hand on her back and promise that she has nothing to worry about. She looks back at you, and with a sigh, resigns herself to get back to work.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, what’s next?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Taking a deep breath, you wait for her answer.
<<else>>
and you just grin right back at her, flexing your biceps under her fingers, making them somehow balloon and harden even more suddenly, definition exploding out of nowhere into absolute peaks of feminine power. This takes Elena by surprise, but even though she seems briefly shocked, you can see her eyes widen while she licks her lips.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Damn, I knew I was strong, but I seriously did not think I was starting to get borderline superhuman! Did you see that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena just nods, unable to articulate a single word.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I swear, this workout might actually make me even stronger, I don’t think I’ve ever done anything like this. Heck, can you imagine? Soon I might be lifting a car like a goddamn comic book character!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You can see Elena’s eyes shifting uncomfortably as they seem to avoid looking at you. But you can’t just leave it alone.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What is it, my muscles are making you uncomfortable? I’ll gladly give yours a little loving as well!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And you step closer to Elena, giving her arm a firm squeeze, feeling the muscle contract involuntarily as you do. As she freezes, you add:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, Elena, just admit it - these muscles are pretty hot. I can clearly see you agree, no need to be so bashful!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You can hear Elena breathing faster, but decide not to push her any more.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, what are you waiting for? These muscles aren’t going to grow by themselves! Give me another task!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
<<elseif $muscle > 70>>
You look at the box, thinking for a second - when it finally hits you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Elena? You know what? I think between the two of us, we can lift this box."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Ma che?!?// A forklift had to bring this here!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So? How much can a forklift handle? I seriously think between the two of us, it’s not farfetched that we can do it."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena hesitates, takes a deep breath and looks at you and the container. You shrug:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why don’t we just try? What’s the worst that could happen? It’s not like we are going to break the stones?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I couldn’t forgive myself if you got hurt!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Pretty sure I can handle myself. Besides, I promise I’ll be careful. Here, you take that side, and I’ll take this one, and we’ll just tip them in the hole."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Unable to fight back, Elena acquiesces and grabs one side of the container. With the other under your fingers, you start exerting pressure to lift the object off the ground. You watch as both your shoulders and arms start contracting, revealing the amazing effort being employed. For the first few seconds the box refuses to budge, and you admittedly start wondering if this wasn’t a bad idea... until it shakes, and slowly rises off the ground.<br><br>
Heaving a bit, the two pairs of arms, fully pumped and with veins at full display, manage to move the large container towards the pit. You confer with Elena between deep breaths, figuring out the logistics of tipping the box sideways to dump its contents. Elena shows a mix of concern and concentration, but is too focused to make a fuss. So at the count of three, the two giant women start turning the box, and with a loud hissing sound, dump the thousands of pebbles into the hole. By the time it’s empty, the crate is light enough for Elena to handle by herself and put it somewhere safe.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Ce l'abbiamo fatta!!!// We did it!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I never doubted you could do it. And the two of us together? That box never had a chance!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena stops for a second, looking at her dirt-caked hands. She slides one over her forearm, all the way to her upper arm, resting her palm over her pumped biceps, in a contemplative mood.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You really are something else, Elena! I’m glad to have someone like you in my life."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She looks at you, still riding that vibe.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I guess we are kind of cool."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
The way she pronounces ‘cool’ with her thick accent is downright adorable and makes you want to squish her cheeks. But you settle for asking what’s next on the docket.
<<else>>
<<addMinutes 75>>and you just sigh, resigned, knowing this will be a long and boring task, but what else can you do? So you take your bucket and slowly the two of you just keep dumping bucketful after bucketful, getting very uncomfortable as you have to reach deeper into the box.<br><br>
It takes a long time, but eventually you are 3/4 of the way down, enough for the two of you to just tip de box sideways and dump the rest.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"God, I thought we’d never finish."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say, wiping your sweaty and dusty forehead.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Phew, so what’s next?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Hopefully nothing this bothersome, you hope.
<</if>><br><br>
Elena shows you a brief video on her phone on how to place, level and secure the timbers at the borders. Seems simples enough. Thankfully, due to the high strength shared by the two of you, handling the wood is fairly trivial, and the power tools make short work of the foundation built. You set some music on your phone and the two of you continue to prepare the base of the greenhouse, as well as start assembling the walls.<br><br>
Hours pass by, and though it is hard work, you two find a groove where one occasionally stops to help the other, making sure each plank is straight and level while the other screws or nails it together. You constantly catch each other, head bopping to the rhythm of the music, laughing and smiling. There’s an indescribably feeling of joy as the tasks are accomplished as a team, giving you a sense of unity you’d never felt before. Chances are, either of you could have done this without the other... but together not only it goes several times faster - but you are having so much fun that time literally flies by as the skeleton of the building goes up.<br><br>
By the time either of you actually bothers to look at the clock, it’s way past lunchtime, and your stomachs are collectively growling.<br><br>
Elena’s face lights up with a smile.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, I prepared some lasagna for us. I’ll go in and get it in the oven, can you start anchoring the wires while I work on that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yes, ma’m!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena giggles at your response, covering her mouth as she does so. You get working on drilling the holes and planting the anchors while she heads inside. It doesn’t take too long for you to start smelling the cheese and tomatoes from the sauce, making you salivate. Still, you just try to expedite the process so you can be ready when she comes out with the grub.<br><br>
And before too long, the four walls are anchored and Elena comes out balancing a very large tray on her hands, still wearing her frilly pink apron. When you see the two humongous plates of homemade lasagna, you bite your lips with anticipation. Elena just approaches as you wipe your forehead, very elegantly crossing her legs and sitting down on the floor as she passes one of the stacked trays for you, before handing you a plate and a gigantic mug of ice-cold lemonade.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Ecco qui,// here you go."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Despite being a tad rude, you barely wait before digging into the delicious pasta. This elicits a happy laughter from Elena, who seems very proud of how hungrily you seem to attack the dish. She also hands you a napkin to clean your lips of the excess tomato sauce.<br><br>
As you delight yourself in the lasagna, Elena grabs tiny spoonfuls, politely eating each as she seems to fail the urge to just watch you waiting. You smile back, speaking with your mouth full:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"WIS IS WEWICIOUS!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She seems to understand that you find it delicious, as you wipe your plate clean before she’s even done with a third of hers.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Thanks, Elena, this really hit the spot! Now I’m read to finish this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And so you get up, stretching while you wait for her to finish. You offer to bring the trays and plate in, and do the dishes, but she insists that you can just leave it by the door, which you do.<br><br>
Fed and ready, you ask what is next.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"We need to build the... how do you call them? Uh, trusses?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She shows you some diagrams, and you get to work. Now that you got this woodwork thing down pat, it’s rather trivial. Next up is installing the two so you have the base for the roof.<br><br>
<<if $height >= 199>>
Thanks to your height, both of you can just work on attaching the tresses by lifting the thing manually and placing it there. It’s a cinch, and makes you wonder how non-enhanced people even manage such a task - but that’s someone else’s problem. 
<<else>>
Given Elena’s height and strength, she can just raise and place the trusses on the frame, so you get a ladder and power tools, and get the piece attached for the frame rather quickly. 
<</if>><br><br>
With the base ready, the two of you proceeds to set the rest of the beams that form the ceiling of the structure. You can’t help but feel like the two of you were born for this, as things just somehow click and work. And soon you are back finishing the door frame and ready to start installing the sheathing on the lower half. Getting the plates nailed in is so simple and fun that Elena and you just start joking around, playing with the pieces and generally being goofs. The high sun certainly doesn’t make things easier, as the heat now has your clothes drenched in sweat and sticking to your skins - but it means you have a very good look at Elena’s upper body (which, you suppose, goes both ways). Despite her rather large proportions, there’s a lightness and softness to her that is hard to explain. Her graceful movements and peaceful disposition make you feel safe and welcome, and just kind want to lay your head against her chest and be hugged. And with all the fun going on, you sneak a few slaps against her solid back, which she takes with a happy disposition.<br><br>
With the sill and trim done, she instructs you to start nailing the siding while she deals with the transparent part that will let the light through while keeping the heat in. Elena surprises you with her pick of material.While you fully expected to have it made with glass, she shows you a pile of twin-wall semiopaque polycarbonate sheets.<br><br>
She explains that it was considerably cheaper and easier to install, which you can’t argue against. She starts cutting the sheets while you install the siding, and you find your heart racing as you realize you are close to getting done as the sun starts heading heading down.<br><br>
By the time you are done with the siding, Elena has all the polycarbonate cut. It’s weird, you were fully expecting to deal with these heavy (well, comparatively, given your strength) and fragile plates - instead, it’s these pieces could be manipulated by a child, and are flexible enough that they don’t need to be treated like their brittle counterparts. In many ways, that is a big relief, as it enables the two of you to continue the process in the same relaxed way as before.<br><br>
It’s hard to believe, but the only things left now are putting the ridge cap and the last beams on the roof. You both take a second to look at the fruits of your labor with pride, before putting these finishing touches.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, we really did it, didn’t we?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"That we did. And it’s not even that late in the afternoon."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, why don’t you do the honors and get the orchid, then?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Actually, would you mind? I want to get the temporary irrigation system in."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, it’s still in the living room? I’ll get the trays in and do that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"//Grazie//."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And so you head in, grabbing the trays on the way. You decide to go ahead and do the dishes so Elena doesn’t need to worry about that, before grabbing the oversized basket.<br><br>
By the time you are back, she’s already ran the temporary hose and set up the pot for the orchid. As she finishes putting the dirt in, she watches as you carry the basket in.<br><br>
An image takes place in your mind’s eye. Dressed in white flowy fabric, you don’t see a greenhouse, but a gazebo. And that’s not a plant pot, but an altar. As you make your procession towards Elena, she doesn’t have a trowel in her hand, but a box with rings, looking at you lovingly.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You can just leave the basket there. I’ll transplant the //orchidea//, thanks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And so you snap out of your daydream. Holy shit, what was that? You grow completely red in the face, speechless.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, I just remembered, Elena, I, huh, have another thing I gotta do, so I should be going. I’m sure you can take it from here! So, tata! See ya later! Byeeee!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena watches, mouth open, as you skedaddle out of there in a hurry, heart beating like crazy. You are still hyperventilating as you reach the bus stop, trying to process all of that in your head as you head back to your apartment.`
