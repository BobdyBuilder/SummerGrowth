        content: `As you collect all parts of the compressed file in a folder, a new diary file is revealed. What was it that Toshi felt the urge to separate behind seven different passwords? Anxiously, you double-click the file, which seems to have a quick introduction, is a list of excerpts that were excised for the rest of his documents.<br><br>“I can’t believe I let my lawyer convince me that I had to redact all these vital observations from my computer and delete it everywhere for safety. Ugh, don’t these guys get how science is done? You can’t just erase progress! I’ll just separate the more, as he says, and I quote: ‘PROBLEMATIC’ entries and fragment it so no one else finds it. That ought to do it.”<br><br>Huh. So it does connect to all those rumors that made the news. What kind of trouble did he get into?<br><br>“August 20th, 2019<br>Just when I thought that my passion for academia was starting to wane, I had this dream - it was a bizarre surreal experience, a bear climbing a tree that just kept going on forever. But just as he was about die of hunger, he bites the bark and sucks the honey inside. It allows him to keep going forever... and when I woke up, I had this idea on how to genetically unlock the potential of the cells in our body.<br><br>I ran to the lab, and started experimenting, but quickly hit several roadblocks. I actually spent the last three days there, sleepless. My friends dragged me home when I just collapsed of exhaustion. And when I next woke up, I knew exactly what to do. That was last week.<br><br>I now have in my hands what I believe might be the first step in fully unlocking human potential. But I cannot run the risk of having someone stop my research with meager concerns about ethics and safety. Therefore, I will bring my findings to my apartment and purchase my own equipment so I can continue this away from the eyes of anyone who could tattle on me.”<br><br>Yikes, that’s going seriously into mad scientist territory there. I can understand why his lawyer had problems with THAT entry. But there are more!<br><br>“October 5th, 2019<br>I don’t understand why the distilled elements seem to have no effect whatsoever! I managed to have the cells react individually in a controlled environment - more efficient energy production, faster reproduction, more resilience, dramatic specialization... but as soon as I expose living organisms to it, nothing happens! I can’t have gone this far only to stop here! If my calculations are correct, the effects on living tissue would be unbelievable.”<br><br>A lot of the entries beyond this point are very frustrated ramblings with science that goes WAY over your head. But at some point he seems to start raving about the so-called Gene Unlocker - and the need to make a version SPECIFIC for humans, which leads to the January 2020 entry you had read in one of the previous files. Hmmm.<br><br>There is a separate picture he took of a napkin, it just seems like a long list of effects he scribbled down quite haphazardly. You go through it, seeing several effects listed: follicle growth stimulation, increased muscle density, improved vascular potential, instantaneous cellular multiplication, permanent synaptic rewiring, adipose redistribution, cellular reconstruction… the list goes on and on. It seems to confirm he achieved several of the possible effects speculated on the other file. It even suggests the possibility of even more undiscovered ones!<br><br>The entries seem rarer after this, since most of these were not redacted from the other documents. However, there is one later than all the other ones, around the same time that the scandal broke in the campus.<br><br>“February 13th, 2020<br>Fuck, I’m going to have to disappear for a while. I can’t believe I let someone else be affected by my experiments, and now the entire faculty is coming after my ass. I can’t believe they would do this when I’m so close to this major breakthrough. I could change humanity!<br><br>But right now, the most important thing is that I need to make everything that could link this back to me disappear! Since I only have this last bottle of Gene-Unlocker that I will take with me, I’ll get rid of the distillations all over the campus - should be easy to just leave some boxes around, people will think they are energetic drinks and just help themselves, making it harder to trace it back to me.<br><br>The bigger probem is that I need to somehow find someplace for this giant professional still I’ve been using to create further distillations! It’s already been pre-calibrated for the boiling point of all major elements in them, and I can’t risk the police finding it. I guess the best idea would be to sell it - but not online, where it would be easy to trace. The old chemistry professor that retired last year seems to have opened a thrift store, that might be a good place - her memory is crap and I doubt the cops would get anything from her.”<br><br>Wait, is he talking about Tasha? Is she a former chemistry professor? Wow, you’d never guess. It might be time to go talk to her - and maybe see if she still has this equipment!<<set $tashaChemistryProfessorDiscovered to true>>`

After changing into your workout attire, you start your procession around the weight racks and machines. And so you engage in the ritual of chemistry you\'ve learned over the last days: sweat and iron create muscle, as you dutifully complete rep after rep, blood engorging your firm muscles and pumping them up.<br><br>The process has become routine, and you tune out the world as you go from exercise to exercise, getting into the zone as you concentrate into pushing your body to its limits. Which is probably why you are surprised when you catch a reflection in the mirror of a guy watching as you finish a set of biceps curls. He is wearing red exercise shorts and a gray sleeveless shirt, revealing an average physique… which, truthfully, you\'d probably be envious of not that long ago.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Oh, sorry… I didn\'t mean to stare! I… uh… sorry, I\'m just new here… and I saw you doing everything so naturally… it was kind of hypnotizing."<</Dialogue>><br><br>He blushes, tripping over himself verbally as he tries to get out of the mess he sprung himself into.<br><br><<if $shyConfident > 1>>You suppress a giggle and raise your left arm, waving your palm with a flourish as you give him an impressive flex of your biceps.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? These little puppies here?

I hope someday I can get some results I can be proud off… but… I just got my membership to this gym yesterday. I admit it\'s somewhat intimidating, seeing all of you use all this equipment so naturally. I won\'t lie, I\'m a bit envious, I felt like I was just fumbling every time I tried to do anything. I almost didn\'t come back today. "<</Dialogue>><br><br><</if>><<if $shyConfident <= 1 && $shyConfident >= -1 >>You wipe the sweat off your forehead and, with a smile, stand up from the bench - proudly, albeit not on purpose, exhibiting your physique in your body-hugging workout attire.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I just love coming to the gym, nothing quite compares, you know?

You look at this guy and, in your head, you see yourself not that long ago. You remember how awkward it was when you first started, swinging those weights haphazardly without proper form, struggling to get your target reps in even with the lightest one - which is made even harder when you are surrounded by people who look more fit and confident than you. But now the tables have turned, and you can\'t help but feel empathy for the little guy.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, tell you what, why don\'t I run you through some basic routines? I can give you a basic starting set, and help you with your form as I show you each exercise?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"R-really? That sounds great, if you don\'t mind… just… heh… go easy on me? I\'m pretty sure I\'ll have to stick to a much lighter load than you!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You both share a laugh, and you proceed to write him a simple split routine. You walk him through the gym, explaining each exercise with a demonstration - you even make a point of trying to guess the weights he should use, picking them for a demonstration that wouldn\'t even register as a warm-up for you… but allowing you to hand them off directly and helping him repeat it so you can correct any mistakes.<br><br>After some minutes, you lead him to the leg press machine, setting it to what you believe will be a decent challenge for him. However, as he gets to the fifth rep on the last set, you can see him start to struggle.<br><br><<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>In a demanding tone, you order him to continue.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don\'t stop now, you are still going to give me another ten reps, you hear?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>His face reddens even more as he grimaces during his sixth rep. You can see him almost grinding his teeth after the eighth rep, his breath becoming more labored.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That\'s nine, you have six left. Come on! Do it!" <</Dialogue>><br><br>His legs shake, but he keeps going, each rep slower than the one before. You can see he doesn\'t believe he can do it, that same initial insecurity in his eyes.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don\'t you dare give up on me, not after all the work I put in."<</Dialogue>> <br><br>You can see his eyes widen in surprise over your forceful tone, but he gets the message loud and clear. You can see his grip on the handles tighten, and an expression of determination takes over as he now seems to complete the next few reps with renewed focus. However, as he is halfway on his last rep, his legs seem to stop in place, shaking as he seems to give his all to finish.<br><br>You look him in the eye and say with your most serious expression:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Just. Do it."<</Dialogue>><br><br>He takes a deep breath, and finishes the last rep. You lock up the rack for him, and with pride tell him that you expect to keep that same commitment, even when you aren\'t there.<</if>><<if $submissiveDominant <= 1 && $submissiveDominant >= -1 >>You cheer on him, sincerely invested in each rep as if it were your own.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, you can do it!

But the lactic acid is getting the better of him, and you know well how hard it can get.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I know you got this! Half-way through, just keep pushing!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>His effort redoubles, and he grits his teeth, but you can see the pain mounting in his face. It seems like he has reached his limit. In a herculean effort, you try to discreetly spot the heavy weights with just your left hand in a corner he can\'t see - all while disguising your own effort so he won\'t be suspicious.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Four more and you are done, come on!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He cranks another two extremely labored reps… and finally stalls. You can see he won\'t be able to continue, and so you turn the clamp to relieve him.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Congratulations! You did your best, and someday you\'ll do three full sets with even more weight, just go at your own pace and you\'ll get there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><</if>><<if $submissiveDominant < -1 >>You bite your lip, nervously doubting the amount of weight you loaded into the machine. You feel his pain, remembering your early days in your own fitness journey. He looks back at you, expectantly, as if you could somehow lend part of your strength - but all you can do is flash a brief nervous smile.<br><br>He does seem to take solace on your support, and manages a couple more reps, but he clearly seems to be in pain. You keep feeling guiltier about all the weights you added as he pushes himself harder and harder. You start doubting yourself and end up just getting lost in your own thoughts as you second guess the whole plan when… <br><br>His knees buckle under the pressure of the weight, and the rack starts to fall on him. With apparently inhuman speed, you brace the whole rack with your hands! It\'s a considerable weight, especially getting you by surprise like this, but you heroically hold it steadily with great effort.<br><br>The guy stumbles clumsily out of the machine, and still sitting down on the ground, turns the clamp that holds the weight. The commotion calls the attention of other gymgoers, who huddle around to check if everyone is okay.<br><br>You extend a hand to help him up, and with ease pull him back to his feet.<br><br><</if>>He stands up, still breathless, and thanks you profusely. You can\'t help but feel proud of helping another fellow on his first steps of their own journey… a journey that changed your life, and hopefully will do the same for him someday.'

You come to a complete stop and mutter to yourself:<<if $shyConfident > 1>> <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No. I’m not about to let some ass make me feel like this"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You approach the nearest building and, surprising yourself, kick your right leg straight up, resting your heel against the wall on an impressive stretch.

Your bottom wear is stretched to its limits, and so is the attention of everyone nearby, including the two rude guys - who seem to have frozen in their tracks with your little show. Your turn your face to them as you raise your palms against the wall, and ask them with your most flirtatious voice:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, excuse me, could you help me with my stretch? Just push on my back as hard as you can, please?"<br><br><</Dialogue>><br><br>The pair seems completely dumbfounded and somewhat uneasy with the request, but speechlessly comply.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, excuse me, could you help me with my stretch? Just push on my back as hard as you can, please?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You make it a point of not letting them move you a single inch, holding firmly as he increases the pressure. You keep teasing them, until the friend joins in, and they are both pushing with all their might. Still, you hold, steady as a rock. And then you engage your trapezius and deltoids, engorging them in a flex under the four hands. You can almost swear you feel a tingle on your skin where they are touching, as if their insecurities manifest like an aura where they make contact.<br><br>Even though you can’t see their faces, you just know you have shut them up completely with your little display, and let out a little relieved sigh.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don’t worry, I’ll have a… more capable friend… help me later.

The anger starts bubbling up from the pit of your stomach, and you feel your muscles tensing. Your whole body is like a bowstring, being drawn closer and closer to a snapping point - and you can see the two guys beginning to get intimidated by your reaction.<br><br>And that, somehow, makes something click in your head. They aren’t worth your trouble. In fact, their opinions don’t really matter at all to you.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know what? I don’t care. You guys are just jealous. I bet you two have your own streams and can’t even get anyone to watch you. Send me a message when you actually get double-digits followers!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And with that, you put your index finger on your nose and stick out your tongue while you wink, making sure to give your biceps a nice flex for extra effect. The pair blushes as you skip and hop around them, getting back on your way.<br><br>As you gain distance, you overhear one of them confessing to the other that you are actually kinda cute. You can’t help but smile.<</if>>`

You gladly accept, sitting in her tea room (which brings back memories of the tea parties you used to hold with your dolls - as you feel entirely out of scale with the rest of the scene).<br><br>Before you leave, the foreman asks if you already have a job. You decline politely:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know what?

You do look gigantic, but your eyes betray you - it’s also just the same <<print $playerFirstName>> <<print $playerLastName>> your mom used to carry in her arms. The cognitive dissonance makes your head hurt a bit. You laugh, recontextualizing all those times your uncles used to talk about how much you had grown… and wonder what they would say now. Probably nothing like that. You frown as you think they’d probably be scared of you.<br><br>This hits you hard: the realization that you’ve become so strong you need to be careful of what you do. The responsibility that comes with it may just be heavier than the stuff you lift.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >= 80>>You notice there’s a nasty oil stain where the couch was, and you should probably take the opportunity to clean it. You grab a cleaning cloth and run to the sink, frustrated at the thought that maybe you won’t be able to remove this stain, since it was there for so long. As you angrily turn the faucet, however, it bends, breaking clean from the wall - water flying all over the place.<br><br>You rush to the main valve, and close it in a hurry. You send a message to the super, asking for him to fix it, and to not just buy another cheap plastic faucet. He responds quickly… and points out that this is an old building, and all the faucets are made of brass.<br><br>You inspect the broken faucet… it is indeed brass. Holy shit, you knew you were getting strong… but… just how strong? Are we really getting dangerously close to superhuman here? You were frustrated, sure, but you weren’t actively trying to break it… what could you have done if you were purposefully trying?!?<br><br>You feel a tingle in your stomach, a mix of thrill and fear. It’s like having this nuclear power plant inside of you - if properly used, it gives you great power. But it also hides a nasty side, a potential for unmitigated disaster. You ponder how you will handle that… especially given… that you realize you are probably still get even stronger than you already are…” <<elseif $muscle >= 60>>Since it’s not where it used to be, you decide to go ahead and sweep under the couch - there’s quite a bit of dirt there. You grab a broom and start doing a little cleaning. Finding yourself lost in your thoughts, you ponder about being more careful around your furniture - it would be hard to afford constant repairs. But as the sweeping continues, you end up breaking the broom handle clean in the middle.<br><br>You look at the thick wooden handle. Before moving here, you remember chasing a rat at your old house, hitting that very same broom with all your might against the floor, repeatedly. But now, just doing some casual sweeping, you accidentally cleaved it in two parts. Just how strong are you getting?<br><br>There’s a mix of excitement and fear - on one hand, you feel like there’s this ever-expanding potential, waiting to be unleashed from within. You want so very badly to see how strong you could possibly get…<br><br>But… on the other hand… you also realize you can break things, or worse, hurt people. This shadow stands over you, ever present. And as these two facets of your conscience fight, part of you knows that there’s little chance you’ll just stop growing.”<<else>>Well, the crack on the wood isn’t too bad - you think you might just be able to splint it. So you grab a piece of wood, your hammer and some nails, and quickly get to work reinforcing the structure.<br><br>Carpentry, however, was never your specialty. You set the lumber in place, prepare the nail and start hitting… you hammer away, but it doesn’t take long until you’ve broke BOTH pieces of wood.<br><br>Well, I guess I just need to get better wood, right? Frustrated, you just forcefully put the hammer back in its fixed bracket shelf… which breaks right under it. Oops.<br><br>As you inspect the damage, you realize these were metal shelves. And you just cleaved the screws themselves from concrete. And these were some THICK screws. Sure, the shelf itself acted as a lever but… you are getting STRONG. Much stronger than you realized.<br><br>You give your flexed biceps a squeeze. Damn, they feel solid. It’s not just the thickness of the muscle - the sloped contour sure feels nice… but… they are, I don’t know, dense? It’s strangely arousing, realizing that you have this thing inside you growing, becoming better… a vast potential, just waiting to be tapped. It drives you to work harder and harder to figure it out.<br><br>You sit down cross-legged by the flipped couch. You find yourself unable to stop fantasizing about getting stronger and stronger. Why have you gone in this rabbit hole, you wonder, as you easily turn the couch back to its original position.<</if>>'

You smirk, feeling very thankful for the fire they lit up and… well… apparently has been bearing some fruit - very FIRM fruits, you think, as you give your upper arm a squeeze.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Did you see the latest gymtok thread?

It is driving me NUTS!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"I KNOW, RIGHT?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You do feel somewhat indebted to them, as they seem to have helped stoke this fire that has brought you some serious gains. The question is… should you reward them?<br><br><span id="choice"><<link "I dunno, I don’t want to come across conceited… but I appreciate their taste">><<replace "#choice">>You approach them from behind and, over their shoulders, watch the video of a very fit girl doing a bunch of chin-ups, it is indeed kinda hot.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Damn, that IS hot… so glad she’s wearing that backless top!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The two guys get startled, not expecting a third wheel on their impromptu online female muscle appreciation. They are even MORE startled as they turn around to find a statuesque fit girl behind them. <br><br><<if $muscle >=80>>Nothing could have properly prepared them for the MAMMOTH BEAST that you are, however, as you are far beyond anything they thought possible in the muscles department, male or female. With their respective jaws down, they can’t even get a full word out, let alone a sentence.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m so glad I’m not alone in appreciating a muscular woman! I never knew guys could be into strong girls…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You place your arm across your chest and give a small, humble flex, making your gigantic pythons flare with immense mass - round rock-hard globes merge from your capped shoulder into your biceps, with veins prominently showcased in what would seem like an impossible showcase of muscles and strength. Four eyes are immediately drawn to your demonstration, and one of the guys makes a weird, throaty noise as he tries to unsuccessfully breath with a constricted airway from the shock.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know, I really got into working out once I saw all the praise you had for muscle girls - I feel like I kinda owe it to you. Your passion was a great incentive, and really got me going!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The comment seems to break their minds even more. One of them manages to get a few words out.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait… that wasn’t that long ago… how long have you been… working out?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You make some quick mental calculation and tell them how many weeks since you started. Their eyes somehow find a way to open even wider. One of them looks around, looking for a hidden camera or some other explanation that might help make sense of this insanity.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >=60>>You aren’t sure what they expected to find behind them, but a bodybuilder-sized young woman was NOT it, clearly, as they let out a nervous laughter.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"HOLY SHIT, YOU ARE JACKED!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He quickly covers his mouth, realizing he said that out loud. You giggle, and raise your arm in a shy and cute little flex as you smile.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I guess I got pretty strong! I was actually motivated by a conversation you guys had some days ago - really got me into the whole lifting thing!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The other guy raises his hand towards your biceps, but stops in his tracks, still mesmerized.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you wanna cop a feel? I guess you can’t do that on TekTok… go ahead!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The guy looks at your eyes, then your arm, then back to your face. He seems confused and pretty intimidated, so you nod to reinforce that it’s okay. His hand finishes its intended course, landing over your big and hard round biceps. His neck shifts forward and his jaw drops and he gives your granite-like biceps a tight squeeze, finding no give whatsoever - unable to even cover the top half of your arm with his fingers.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Dang! I never thought muscle would be this firm!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I really gotta thank you guys - I might still be a stick girl if you guys hadn’t lit this fire on me. So… thanks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give them a cute wink. One of them pinches his arm, because he’s pretty sure he must be dreaming.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >=40>>They probably expected anything but to find another girl just as jacked as the one doing the chin-ups on their screen - which is made immediately clear by their expression of shock.<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Whoa! Babe alert!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The pair just scan you, top to bottom, realizing you look just like the fitness-competitor level women they’ve been ogling online all along - except right there in front of them… actually TALKING TO THEM! The surprise seems to have gotten them somewhat discombobulated.<br><br>You tilt your head, somewhat confused at their reaction. They seem to continue to admire your hard work, their eyes continuously following your meaty legs, your toned arms, your capped shoulders and your protruding abs. You’d think that for two guys who appreciate fit women, they wouldn’t find it so amazing…?<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Whoa! Do you have a TekTok account?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<if $furniture.includes("web cam")>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, but I do some streaming every now and then… I suppose I have some fans of my physique there…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You find yourself giving them a brief flex of your biceps almost instinctively, and they both wolf-whistle simultaneously. You giggle, not quite used to real-life compliments like this - it’s usually just the chat going a bit wild.<br><br><<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, but I’ve been thinking about getting a webcam and doing some streaming… maybe something with a fitness theme going? I don’t know…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Both of them shout simultaneously: “YES, PLEASE DO!” It makes you giggle.<</if>>They promise to keep an eye out for you online, and you decide you should thank them:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know, I started my fitness journey because I overheard the passion with you two were talking about muscular girls some days ago. So… thank you two, for setting me on this path!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They both look at each other, incredulously, as they bow and thank you back for your effort. That was surprisingly cute!<br><br><<else>>The two were not expecting to be approached by a girl during their… ahem… private discussion… so they are momentarily stunned, before fully appreciating that you are actually quite fit. Maybe not as big as some of the girls they stalk online - but it is clear to them that you work out.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Oh, hey! Not looking to shabby yourself, girl! Bet you work out too, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you can tell…?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You shrug in a cute girly way, then playfully flex your biceps. Neither of them expect the nice little bump that jumps out from your upper arm to be so salient.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"DANG!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Actually, I have you two to blame for that… I overheard you talking some days ago… and I guess I got bit by the fitness bug! It’s actually pretty cool, I keep surprising myself at how strong I’m getting!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give your quads a slap, making a loud clapping noise as your hand meets the firm resistance of your thighs. They shudder a bit, clearly aroused by your little display there.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Uh, you… you certainly look it!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I know, right? And this is just from a few days - can you imagine how buff I’m gonna get by the end of the summer?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You hear them audibly gulping as they nod in awe.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really, this is like, super-exciting… and I really do think I’m stronger than I look, even! I bet I could squat one of you right now, if I wanted!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>One of them chokes at that comment, and you laugh. The other asks if you really are serious about that.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, you don’t look THAT heavy! Jump up!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You turn around, giving the dude a piggyback. You estimate him to be like 130 pounds… so you proceed to pull some nice squats, and you can feel his heart beating faster against your chest… you could easily get used to that. You put the guy down, and he’s speechless.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Fuck! I totally should have filmed that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You laugh at the comment, but both of them look dead serious about it.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, give me some time! Maybe next time I stumble on you I might be able to bench press you - or maybe squat both of you! I’ll make that my next goal!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You complete that with a wink, and you could swear they might’ve just climaxed from that comment alone.<br><br><</if>>Well, as it turns out, they really did motivate you… and just the thought of more people sharing this passion only makes the ember inside you burn brighter. You wonder how buff you’ll get in the future, and remind yourself that this is still just the beginning of your journey!<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>><</replace>><</link>><<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 1 "How about just showing off a bit?">><<replace "#choice">>You approach them from behind and clear your throat. They turn, not quite ready for what is expecting them.<br><br><<if $muscle >= 80>>They start by your feet, and start tracking their heads up. Their jaws drop at your calves; They gasp at your thighs; Hyperventilation begins at your abs; There is slight shaking as they take in your arms and pecs… and finally freeze completely when they see your face.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So I heard the two of you appreciate a strong girl?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You grab both by their belts, and lift each with one arm off the ground with relative ease.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do I qualify? Or should I go back to the gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They wobble and shake, and you put them down before someone gets hurt. They are still shaking, partly due to the scare of being easily hoisted from the ground, part from just trying to wrap their brains around your enormous muscularity.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Can I interest you… in a little show? I feel I owe you one…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You go in a most muscular pose, and their eyes almost pop out of their respective skulls. You do a double-biceps for good measure, and encourage them to cop a feel.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, you should check how hard these arms are - they could use a little appreciation!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Each one of them goes for a different arm, and both are in equal disbelief in their incapacity to even envelope a fraction of your upper arm in their hands. They squeeze with all their might, but you just force your flex that tiny bit more and they almost flip out at the sheer durability of your flesh - they can’t even make any dent.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, you already figured out I’m kinda strong… but I’m pretty sturdy too… here… punch me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You raise your <<print $outfit.top()?.name || $outfit.overwear()?.name>>, revealing your fully flexed cobblestone abs. One of them almost chokes.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, give it your best shot! I really wanna see if my training is paying off!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They look at each other, trying to figure out how to proceed. The one who is more fit takes a deep breath and looks you in the eyes for confirmation. You nod, and he gives a very solid punch, which makes a muffled noise. You barely feel it, really… but… oh, poor guy… it looks like he might have hurt his hand a bit.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, I’m sorry… I must have gotten a bit carried away… I was just excited to share… because I started getting serious on my workouts after I heard you two talking about how much you dig muscular girls."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait, but that wasn’t really that long ago… you just started then?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, and I’m planning to keep going, though it’s getting easier and I’m getting more practice, so I expect my gains could actually start coming in faster… I wonder how strong I’ll be by the end of the summer!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The two fall to their knees, jaws agape. You might just have exploded their brains a bit. They both crawl to your feet and repeat they are not worthy. You laugh, and pull them up by their collars.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >= 60>>They find themselves in the presence of a veritable female bodybuilder, which is probably more than they were used to online - let alone in person. You let a sly smile out, and just give them a double-biceps pose with little fanfare. They watch as the peaks of your arms just keep going up… and up… and up… until you got a veritable mountain of muscle for show.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is it true that you two appreciate a strong girl?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You proceed into a most muscular pose, then reveal your legs with a flex of your thighs and calves.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ve been working hard on my physique since I heard you two talking about how hot you thought muscular women are… and I can’t deny - the results seem to confirm that, wouldn’t you say?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You might have blown their minds a bit too much, they seem momentarily unable to respond. You decide a quick peek of your abs may be in order, and you reveal your midriff. It jolts the two awake almost immediately.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"HOLY SHIT, YOU’RE HOT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You giggle at his abrupt comment, which you assume left his lips before his brain realized he should use his internal voice.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I suppose this muscle does look nice on me. I really gotta thank you, not sure I would\'ve worked quite as hard… you know… before hearing you two discuss how you thought it looked hot."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait, but that wasn’t really that long ago… you just started then ? !?

You give them both a tight hug, lifting them off the ground.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >= 40>>You smirk, and ask:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me, which way… TO THE GUN SHOW ? "<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give them a nice double-biceps flex, pointing your fingers to one side then the other, making your muscles twitch and roll on your arms - like you had a weasel running inside them. One of the guys coughs, and gets red in the face from lack of oxygen as he tries to catch his breath again.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You like these ? Wait until you check THESE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You turn backwards, raising yourself to tiptoes as you flex your calves and glutes, giving them an amazing view of your very toned legs and bubble butt.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m so excited, I started getting serious about my lifting after I heard you two saying how you liked fit women… and I have to say, if I knew that, I’d have started earlier!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Whoa, you look damn fine, girl!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I’m really just starting… I got serious when I heard you two talking about TekTok… but I’m going to keep going - I think I’m going to get pretty big and strong!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait, you are serious ?

A very respectable bump raises from your arm, and they both go “OOOOH!”<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Hey, that’s really nice - you don’t see girls with muscles like that every day!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I know, right ?

You wipe the moisture off of your forehead, and roll up your clothes as much as you can, trying to let the wind cool you down… but also revealing more of your body in the process.<br><br> While it certainly feels a lot fresher, by putting your assets on display, you seem to be calling more attention than usual. With your arms, legs and abdomen fully revealed, your muscles are turning heads anytime someone passes by. This includes an older woman, who looks at you and just stops on her tracks. As you are about to pass her, she raises her arm in front of you, impeding your passage.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random Woman">>"Wait - I MUST speak with you!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You shrug, confused.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random Woman">>"This physique of yours - it is… words escape me.

You try to give a formal bow as you start going your way, unrolling your clothes again, and the woman follows you for a bit, making you increase your pace to a run.<br><br> <<if $shyConfident > 1>> Frankly, the admiration was kinda hot… it just feels a little intimidating coming from a more mature woman. You resist the urge to roll up your clothes again, but you are already thinking about buying some more revealing clothes in the future…” <<else>> You feel a little embarrassed by the attention she dispensed… but you’d be lying if you said it did not feel a bit nice being the object of someone’s lust.

But now you own your new stature, waltzing like a supermodel with your much longer legs, decided steps. You’d be lying if you didn’t say that you weren’t somewhat excited with the prospect of being taller, as it always kinda bothered you being called several names for your low stature when you were growing up (or weren’t, as the case used to be, unlike now).<br><br>As you continue on your way, you see some guy washing the window of the store, and he just drops his sponge when he sees you.

As someone who was until very recently a “shorty”, you know where he is coming from.

Huh - you’ve heard about CruxFit before - a lot, in fact, as they seem to spend more on marketing than anything else - but the stuff they are doing seems pretty challenging… and somewhat enticing to your new strength training-minded self.

You see sweat dripping from her face on the ground as she grits her teeth after another half minute, her arms starting to visibly shake. You flex your fingers up and down a bit in jest, smiling back to signal that you are not giving up so easily. It’s pretty impressive, considering your load of <span class="hidden"><<getMeasurement "weight" false>></span><<print $weight>>, which is clearly much heavier than hers.<br><br>As the third minute rolls in, she falls, panting and laughing.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Damn, I should have known better than to challenge you!

Oh, it is so on!<br><br>As the second minute passes by, you can see she’s starting to struggle - but your core and arms remain resolute. You see sweat dripping from her face on the ground as she grits her teeth after another half minute, her arms starting to visibly shake. You flex your fingers up and down a bit in jest, smiling back to signal that you are not giving up so easily. It’s pretty impressive, considering your load of <span class="hidden"><<getMeasurement "weight" false>></span><<print $weight>>, which is clearly much heavier than hers.<br><br>As the third minute rolls in, she falls, panting and laughing.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Damn, I should have known better than to challenge you!

You smile, and get up.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I suppose I could kept going on the plank for a while more, but I figured it would just be boring for everyone, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Everyone comes and wants to have a look at your abs, which right now look amazing from what they just had to go through.

The two of you laugh, leaning against each other as you two get up.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Geez, girl… you just come in bulldozing everyone like that… I think I said that already, but you are LITERALLY goals!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Everyone gives a laugh, and the whole group comes to congratulate the two of you.<br><br><<else>> As the group goes back to their planks, you join in..

You can feel the fatigue setting in, but you know you still have some plank time in you.<br><br>As the third minute approaches, you see she won’t hold much longer - and you are not sure about yourself either. Shaking, you hold with all your strength and stamina, and you can hear your opponent groaning while she stifles a nervous laugh. As the third minute crosses, however, she just tumbles down, and you hold another couple of seconds before following her, panting as you recover your breath.<br><br>The trainer offers the two of you his hands, and pulls you up - getting slightly surprised at how heavy you are, almost as if you were denser than your newfound friend, making him unbalanced towards your side. Still, with everyone up, the attention quickly turns to you.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"OK, you are going to have to excuse me, but…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Without any ceremony, she just reaches for your abdomen, examining your stomach and feeling the muscle with her fingers.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"HOT DAMN!

I promise, one day, I’ll get strong like you, no matter how long it takes."<</Dialogue>><br><br>The three of you drink in this warm moment of sorority, and you have a big group hug. <<if $muscle >= 50>>You just end up lifting the other two off the ground, which leads to some more laughs.<</if>><br><br>You say your goodbyes, and wonder if you’ll ever come across them again in the future.<<else>>You aren’t quite confident enough, however, and decide to sit this one out.
