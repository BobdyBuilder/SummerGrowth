Browsing for a bit, you look for any jobs are available. You get the impression that the entire town is in a bit of a slump. Most positions either demand you have a degree, or travel WAY far! But as you search, you get a notification from some big streaming site. Hmmm. If there are no jobs available, all you need to get started with streaming is a webcam. Any good electronics store should have those. Itâ€™s not guaranteed income but... it might be worth a try, right? You also see an advertisement for one of the fitness stores in town; the bulk barn. The advertisement is't the clearest on what its about, but you think they're looking for some extra help?
<br><br>
Just as you were about to give up, something catches your eyes. A small advertisement for a low-level data entry job in one of the bigger firms in town. Let's see... strict dress code... no experience required! And it pays surprisingly well! You could schedule a job interview, if you are interested!
