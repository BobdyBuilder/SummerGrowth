:: Bedroom [nobr home] {"position":"1225,900","size":"100,100"}
The one place in your home that is 100% you: neatly arranged and well decorated, it has quickly become your little corner away from the world. Inside here you can shut out all outside noises and just relax. With a big bed and your desk, you have everything you need. Well, other than perhaps a small fridge.
