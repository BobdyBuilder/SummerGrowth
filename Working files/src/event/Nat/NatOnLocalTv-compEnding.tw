You look for Nat, but can only see <<rivalMy>> agent speaking nervously on the phone. You look at her, confused, as she mutes her mic and you just hear Nat shouting frustratedly over the speaker.<br><br>
She explains that <<RivalI>> didn't take the whole situation very well, having to share the stage with other people instead of having the spotlight only for <<rivalMe>>. You shrug, but deep inside, you are getting more and more worried with what <<rivalMy>> ego is doing to <<rivalMe>>. This cannot end wellâ€¦<br><br>
You change back into your street clothes and return home.
