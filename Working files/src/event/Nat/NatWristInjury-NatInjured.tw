:: NatWristInjury-NatInjured [nobr] {"position":"0,0","size":"100,100"}
Nat scoffs and goes back to the barbell, but it's obvious to everyone that <<RivalI>> is overdoing it. <<RivalI>> stops after three reps, and sighs with frustration. <<RivalI>> goes at it one more time… but <<RivalI>> is shaking even more - this is about as agonizing to you as it seems to be to <<rivalMe>>. There are so many words stuck in your throat right now, but you don't know how exactly to get through to <<rivalMe>>… but of one thing you are sure - if you don't do it NOW, the damage could be even worse!
