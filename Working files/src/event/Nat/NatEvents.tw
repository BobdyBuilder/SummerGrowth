		content: `You are still getting your bearings in this new town, and whenever you go out, you tend to just look everywhere in an attempt to memorize some recognizable reference points. The downside of this… is that sometimes you can be a little distracted.<br><br>
            BONK!<br><br>
            You hit a big, very sturdy obstacle and fall on your behind. Ow, ow, ow! Looking ahead, you see a fallen cardboard box with jump ropes, resistance bands, some plastic drink bottles, towels… all sorts of sporting goods. You look up, covering your eyes from the glare of the sun, but all you can see is a very large silhouette covering the light.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Are you alright?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Asks the voice, offering you a hand. You accept the help, and they pull you up like you weigh nothing. As you dust yourself off, you look at the person who was unloading boxes and boxes of workout equipment from a moving truck.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Did you hurt yourself?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No… no, I'm fine… I'm just a bit clumsy at times, no worries."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You finally get a good look at the <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>
                guy - the buzzcut-shaved man has the kind of good looks you see on a perfume ad, with swimmer shoulders and a shirt that is too tight at the chest, but also incredibly tapered at the waist, giving him an impressive hourglass shape. But his face…
            <<else>>
                girl - she sports a half-shaved, dreadlocked visage that gives you Spartan/Viking vibes, and looks like they just jumped out of a trendy crossfit ad, with swimmer shoulders and arms that would not look out of place on a bodybuilder, and visible bulging abs through the fabric, giving her an impressive hourglass shape. But her face… 
            <</if>> it looks eerily familiar.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Phew, I'm glad… sorry, I didn't realize I left so much stuff on the sidewalk. It was pretty irresponsible of me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Indeed, there's A LOT of stuff, and it does seem to be predominantly sports-related - including a big box of trophies: swimming, martial arts, track and field…<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh… no, no, no… I'm the klutz. Hehe… Do you… do you want some help carrying the stuff up?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<RivalI>> takes a good look at your rather petite frame, and you can't help feeling a bit judged. Not that <<rivalI>>'s wrong… <<rivalI>> looks like <<rivalI>> could lift your entire bodyweight with one arm…<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"No worries, I can use the exercise."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<RivalI>> seems to look at your face quite a bit, like <<rivalI>> also somehow recognizes you.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, huh… I guess… I should be going then… sorry again!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Again, no worries. Do watch where you step though..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You too! I mean… uh… good luck with your move!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You blush, still embarrassed, and get on your way.`

Which is great, because apparently some very irresponsible city workers have left an unattended manhole open… with nothing around it! But as you lift your eyes, you see someone carrying a stack of large boxes that covers their field of view… and they are about to fall in!<br><br>
            <<if $shyConfident < -1>>
                You briefly hesitate, but the person is quickly approaching their potential death - and before you realize, you have thrown yourself against the distracted pedestrian.<br><br>
            <<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1>>
                Knowing there's no time to waste, you just throw yourself against the distracted pedestrian.<br><br>

            CRASH!!!
            As you come to, you find yourself surrounded by the fallen boxes, on top of a VERY firm torso.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Ow, owwwww… my hand!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            As <<rivalI>> opens <<rivalMy>> eyes, your noses almost touching, your gazes meet… and the two of you remember something that happened many years ago…
            <div class="boxShadow">You were 8 years old, having fun with your neighbor in the nearby woods. <<RivalI>> teased you for being a scaredy cat, and you decided to prove <<rivalMy>> wrong by climbing a tall tree. You were doing pretty well, too… but a squirrel ran past your hand… and you just remember the world turning into a blur.<br><br>
            Next thing you know, you are on the ground, your leg hurting a lot, and your friend, Nat, is trying to pull you… <<rivalI>> has tears streaming down <<rivalMy>> cheek, and <<rivalI>>'s frustrated. <<RivalI>> leans on top of you, hugging you and apologizing…
            <<Dialogue "youngPlayer" "Young you">>"Oh gosh I'm so sorry..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "youngNat" setup.getRivalName()>>"O-Ow that hurts... M-my hand..."<</Dialogue>>
            </div>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nat?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Ow… <<print $playerFirstName>>?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You get off Nat's chest, and <<rivalI>>'s still rubbing <<rivalMy>> left wrist. <<RivalI>> seems to have landed awkwardly on it.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I'm sorry, Nat… you were about to fall on that manhole, and I just… I didn't even think…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You start nervously collecting the stuff on the ground… some of them are some pretty heavy weight plates and dumbbells… how was <<rivalI>> even carrying all of this?!?<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"<<print $playerFirstName>>... wow, it's been so long… I mean, other than last time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah… you've… grown… since you were 8…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<if $muscle >= 55 || $height >=185 >>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Huh… I could say the same… in fact… is my memory playing tricks on me? You look HUGE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<RivalI>> shakes <<rivalMy>> head, looking at your body confused, comparing it to the day you bumped on <<rivalMy>>.
            <<elseif $muscle >= 35 || $height >=170 >>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Huh… I could say the same… in fact… last time we met…?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<RivalI>> shakes his head, looking at your body confused, comparing it to the day you bumped on <<rivalMy>>.
            <<else>>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"And you… well, you still look as cute as I remember!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Well, at least <<rivalI>>'s nice about your undeveloped body.
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Did… did you hurt your hand?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Ah, this? This is nothing… I got plenty of injuries in sports before, and… ARGH!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<RivalI>> tries to lift the boxes, and <<rivalMy>> wrist is clearly in pain.<br><br>
            <<if $muscle >= 55>>
                You help <<rivalMy>> with the heavier boxes, and <<rivalI>> grabs the light ones on <<rivalMy>> right arm. Nat seems slightly bothered about how you manage to do so like it weighs nothing.<br><br>
            <<elseif $muscle >= 35>>
                You help <<rivalMy>> with the heavier boxes, and <<rivalI>> grabs the light ones on <<rivalMy>> right arm. You can't help but notice that Nat seems confused about how you manage to do so.<br><br>
            <<else>>
                <<RivalI>> somehow manages to load the heavy boxes on <<rivalMy>> right arm, and you help <<rivalMy>> with the light ones. Damn, <<rivalI>> looks incredibly strong - that sleeve looks like it could rip at any second!<br><br>
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, I guess now not only have I failed you when we were kids… but now I also owe you my life…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You'd think <<rivalI>>'d look glad… but, this situation feels very awkward for <<rivalMy>>.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"My apartment is just around the corner, why don't you come over, and we can catch up?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You nod, and the two of you make your way there.<br><br>
            Nat's apartment is… stark, to say the least. It's a small studio, and you could say that 90% of all objects in there are somehow related to some sort of training. <<RivalI>> has a standing rack with lots of very fashionable clothing articles, and a mattress just laying on the ground in the corner.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… nice place?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Thanks for the lie. Yeah, I must look pretty boring… I am just focusing hard on the upcoming competition - I'm going to be in a documentary about bodybuilding competition that is coming up at the end of summer…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<RivalI>> certainly looks like <<rivalI>>'s been putting the work in… and nothing else. There's no TV, no speakers, no books…<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Other than that… been making some money on the side as a model… these supplements don't come cheap, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Your eyes just sparkle… you kinda want to see <<rivalMe>> shirtless, get a better idea of whatever that tight shirt is hiding.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, you are kind of a tough act to follow - so you basically excelled at a bunch of sports, you are a model and you are in a documentary about bodybuilding. Meanwhile I… basically was living with my parents, slacking a whole bunch, and just transferred here. I have a nice friend who is into modeling… the little metal figures he paints, that is."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Nat laughs. Man, you missed that laugh and didn't even realize.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Hey, do you want to come to the meeting with the documentary crew? It's going to be in a couple of weeks, and I could use a wingwoman, it can get pretty boring with all the waiting…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You didn't realize just how much you missed Nat, and it's so great to have a familiar face in town. You agree, and you make a note of the time and place.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, huh, I hate to be THAT person… but I really need to put some cardio in… so… maybe we'll talk later?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Does that mean some shirtless treadmill and jump rope action? Because I'd gladly stay and give you some moral support…."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Uhhhhh…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Haha! Just kidding…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You say, lying through your teeth.
            <<else>>
                You resist the urge to just tell <<rivalMy>> that you don't mind, <<rivalI>> can jump rope and run shirtless and you'll just chill and watch…<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I should be going…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, it was great seeing you. And looking forward to the next time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            And with that, you say your goodbyes and leave.`

You look around, panicked, as flames lick from every viable escape route - leaving you stuck in the cramped and scalding bedroom as the dark smog quickly impairs visibility.<br><br>
You tell yourself to stay calm as you figure your next step - trying frantically to remember all the lessons you were told about what to do in the case of a fire. But your brain is overheated and in overdrive, and you are having a hard time making sense of the situation. As you scream for help, you lungs fill with the suffocating smoke, making you cough even more. You put your hands on your forehead and try to come up with the best plan possible.<br><br>

            Trying your best to remember all the lessons you learned about fire safety, you wet your pillowcase with your water bottle, place it over your mouth and tuck yourself under the bed. You watch in horror as everything around you is engulfed in the dark smoke, and you try to listen to anything that isn’t the crackling of flames, hoping for the sound of an alarm, people shouting… and hopefully, the fire brigade coming to your rescue.<br><br>
            But as you do, the walls seem to start cracking around, as you see bits of it falling from the ceiling. Crying, you assume a fetal position as you grit your teeth, telling yourself that this can’t possibly be happening!<br><br>

            You grab your still-moist towel and empty your bedside water bottle over it, using it a cape as you psyche yourself before running headfirst into the wall of flames that comes from the bedroom door. You struggle to make sense of the situation, but you can’t help yourself as your senses are overwhelmed by this unthinkable situation. Frustrated, you wave your arm back and fiercely hit the concrete wall to your side with a loud THUD!<br><br>
            You cannot believe your eyes, as your fist just breaks through the thick solid concrete, revealing the dirt from the soil outside your basement apartment. And as if things could not get worse, a landslide starts filling your bedroom, burying you as the diminutive space is quickly filled with it!<br><br>

You leave, wondering what that is going to be like… a whole film crew and dozens of wannabe bodybuilders? You suppose you could do worse for your day.<br><br>
            As you arrive, you are somewhat surprised at how small the film crew is: one guy with a camera, the director, and her assistant. On the other hand, there are indeed dozens of bodybuilders of all sizes, genders and styles… some came dressed casually, some are trying to look sharp with fancier clothes - and a handful came in swimsuits and full painted-tan regalia - you were not expecting that.<br><br>
            You quickly spot Nat in the crowd. <<RivalI>>'s not wearing the nice dress shirt from last time, but a very stylish sleeveless hoodie and running shorts, and you have no doubt that <<rivalI>> is taking this very seriously: <<rivalI>> sports rugby ball-sized biceps that are super defined, a chest and abs that stretch the hoodie taut, and <<rivalMy>> legs… damn… <<rivalI>> certainly has NOT been skipping leg day!<br><br>

                <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Interesting - not exactly heavy weight material, but what you lack in size and symmetry, you make up in looks - I could see you in a crossfit spread in a heartbeat!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You'd be glowing with pride at such a comment, but Nat seems almost insulted.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"There's still quite a bit of time until the competition, and I've got a solid base, besides, what do you even know about bodybuilding?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Uh-oh. This time it's the director that is getting indignant. She shoves the clipboard with the release form on Nat's chest quite aggressively.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Do you even know who you are speaking with? I'm one of the top 5 fitness photographers in the country. I know my shit, alright? I definitely have big plans for you in the documentary - but you better lose the attitude."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Nat clearly has a temper and an ego, and so does the director. You figure you might want to intervene…<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you should see <<rivalMy>> as a kid - <<rivalI>> was a completely stick figure - if <<rivalI>>'s gotten this far, I'm confident <<rivalI>>'ll wow you at the contest."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Both of them “hmph” at each other, before the director leaves with the clipboard.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"How DARE she treat me like this?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, you weren't exactly a peach either… but I'm sure that's just the whole reality TV drama vibe, I wouldn't worry about it too much. Besides, I know you are going to shine."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You imagine Nat with the muscle <<rivalI>>'ll probably be putting over the course of the next few months. You need to control yourself not to salivate a bit.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I guess you are right. Still… at least, looking around, the competition isn't TOO bad. I'm confident I will surpass everyone by the time the contest comes."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<RivalI>> certainly is sure of <<rivalMy>>self.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Anyway, I want to get some more training in today, so I'll be heading home. Thanks for stopping by."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, believe me, it was my pleasure! I'll see you around!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                And with that, both of you leave. But you can't help but feel something awakening inside of you. Seeing all these muscular people… there was such an energy there… you feel yourself buzzing on the inside - not only from being aroused by these magnificent physiques, but as if your own body is fighting with itself, inspired by all of this.<br><br>
                Nah, must just be your imagination.

                However, she doesn't face Nat, but you.<br><br>

                <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wow! You look amazing! What's your name?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Errrr… no, I'm not the participant, it's him!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The director inspects the two of you.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"I mean, sure, <<rivalI>>'s got that <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>male<<else>>crossfit<</if>> model thing going, but… let me tell you, I'm a fitness photographer, and you are SIZZLING, girl! Are you sure you are not competing? I can get you a form and we can have you in…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Hey! Um, it's… still my turn, though, right? Aren't we at least going to get my release form and get me processed?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Sure, sure… just give me a second, honey… you, have my card, if you are not going to get processed right now, I want you to have it, in case you change your mind later and decide to compete - I MUST have you in the documentary."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                She is being incredibly dismissive of Nat, and you can see how irritated <<rivalI>> got with that. <<RivalMy>> whole body language changed, and you are feeling quite awkward. You grab the card and pocket it.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"So, where's my form?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Nat says, quite irritated.<br><br>
                The director just gives <<rivalMy>> the clipboard, but continues just sizing you up while Nat fills it out. <<RivalI>>'s clearly getting more worked up.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Here, are you doing some testimonials or any taping today?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The director grabs the clipboard and gives him a generic answer and goes back to her list.<br><br>
                <<print setup.getRivalName()>> is visibly uncomfortable now, and trying not to direct <<rivalMy>> frustration at you… but <<rivalI>>'s not really dealing with it well.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"If they are going to treat their documentary subjects like this - I don't think it will go well for them."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, she seemed nice… she's probably just busy…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, at least you won't be competing, so I don't have to worry about not getting my deserved spot in the film whenever we are together..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                            You do a tentative double biceps pose, and notice several eyes turning your way in the crowd. Quite a few females seem downright intimidated.<br><br>
                            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I mean, sure, you could probably place in <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>the female<<else>>a lighter<</if>> division, you certainly look good.

                            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nat, you certainly changed - you were a stick figure and you were never really dedicated to anything before. I can barely recognize you now, so… you know, don't go making assumptions about me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"This is different, though. Bodybuilding is all about dedication, sacrifice, determination and commitment. True grit.

                            <<print setup.getRivalName()>> lets out a loud hmph. You can't help but feel a bit judged here, and that <<rivalI>>'s acting quite childishly… but you assume it's just the nerves from this whole documentary thing.<br><br>
                            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, I should be going. There's some hard training ahead of me… I'm SURE you understand."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                            The sarcasm in <<rivalMy>> voice is mildly grating. You give <<rivalMy>> a forced smile, and go on your way.<br><br>
                            And you are just itching to lift some truly heavy iron in the near future.

                            Still… there's something stirring inside of you. Like a caged beast, snapping against its captor. You notice your heart beating faster, your breathing getting deeper. Your muscles seem to tense with a mind of their own, getting more pumped and defined just from this whole thing going on inside your head now…<br><br>

    You stand there, silent, as <<rivalI>> pokes your back.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Sorry about that, my training has been a little 24/7 lately, and I kinda needed to be a bit pumped for these pictures… didn't mean to make it awkward…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You squeak an unintelligible answer, and Nat looks amused.<br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Do you know how to operate a DLSR? "<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<RivalI>> asks, handing you a rather daunting camera. You never seen one so close before, but you can at least tell which button takes a picture.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, do I need to focus or measure the light or some other special thing?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Nat laughs.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I set it to full auto mode, and the lighting is already set up. Just… can you sit there for a second so I do some minor adjustments?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You sit at the bench <<rivalI>> laid out in the middle of the lights, and <<rivalI>> starts adjusting their intensity and position.<br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"You've got some good posture, have you done any modeling yourself?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Not really? I mean, it never even occurred to me, frankly. It sounds like something that you are born with or maybe you get discovered or I don't know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Can you just stand a bit more straight? I kinda need to figure how to cover the shadows… let me grab a reflector…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

<</if>>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Oh, trust me, you can be taught how to model… why don't I give you a few pointers later? There, I'm done."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You trade places, and <<rivalI>> sits down again. While you were fumbling with the camera, Nat seems to have turned on a switch or something, because when you are looking at <<rivalMe>> through the viewfinder, it's like a different person: <<rivalMy>> eyes burn with an intensity you cannot put in words, and it makes you feel desired…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Just… take me already…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"What?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Did you say that out loud? Oops… Nat seems to also have reverted to <<rivalMy>> normal self.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry… just… figuring the camera out. Here, let's do this."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
The two of you spend the next ten minutes taking a series of shots in different poses, and Nat seems to almost magically know how to look <<rivalMy>> best. A small move of the arm, a change in the position of <<rivalMy>> legs… a simple bend backwards that makes those abs pop even more as they are revealed from the raised shirt… it feels like it's getting pretty hot in here, must be all these lights…<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Thanks, these turned out pretty good!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Nat says, while checking the shots you took on the camera's screen.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You make it look really easy, too."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Here, let me show you how this works, it's not as hard as you might think…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<RivalI>> motions for you to sit on the bench as <<rivalI>> handles the camera.<br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1 && $muscle > 40>>
    You sit down, and before you know, the spirit of a fierce lioness has taken over your body. That lens trained at you makes you feel sexy and powerful, and you just radiate that energy. Instinctively, you react to Nat's every motion, alternating between sexy smiles and smoldering stares, with some casual displays of your developed physique - you highlight your abs, quads, calves and arms at every opportunity, even though you are barely aware of doing it. Nat is clicking fewer and fewer shots, even though you feel like your posing is actually picking up steam. 
<<elseif $shyConfident > 1>>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Wow, okay, look at you - I don't even have to say anything…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Nat clicks away, and you just find yourself posing without thinking - every time <<rivalI>> moves, you find yourself repositioning instinctively to show all your best assets, never stopping with either radiant smiles or smoldering stares. Nat keeps clicking, but <<rivalI>> seems more and more hesitant as <<rivalI>> keep going.<br><br>
<<elseif $shyConfident > -1 && muscle > 40>>
    You sit down, unsure of what <<rivalI>> expects you to do. Nat puts the camera down and looks straight at you, demonstrating as <<rivalI>> speaks.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"You've got an amazing body, flaunt it! Let's get those shoulders open, reveal all that beautiful torso and the nice core… stretch those toned legs, I want to get all of those… and just remember to smile."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<RivalMy>> compliments hit you real deep, and you couldn't keep yourself from smiling if you tried to. <<RivalI>> makes you feel very at ease, and soon <<rivalI>>'s giving you more posing tips and you are having so much fun while <<rivalI>> clicks away…<br><br>
<<elseif $shyConfident > -1>>
    You sit down, unsure of what <<rivalI>> expects you to do. Nat puts the camera down and looks straight at you, demonstrating as <<rivalI>> speaks.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Pull back your shoulders, I wanna see that pretty torso. And raise your head a little, so we can get your nice eyes… there… now… just… smile…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You find yourself glowing from those compliments, and the smile comes quite naturally. Soon, Nat is clicking away, and giving you small suggestions regarding your posture. You do as <<rivalI>> says, and <<rivalI>> continues clicking.<br><br>
<<else>>
    You sit down, all hunched over yourself. Nat puts the camera down and first walks in front of you and just pulls your shoulders back, then raises your chin. No words, just gentle touches as <<rivalI>> looks at you like some statue <<rivalI>>'s carefully sculpting. You blush at every moment, and feel your heart beating faster and faster.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Now, I need you to look at me… you look amazing, <<print $playerFirstName>>! Just give me that trademark smile of yours!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You force yourself to smile.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Come on, <<print $playerFirstName>>! We both know you can do better than that! Remember when my mom used to bake apple pies, and you'd throw all your charm to get some? I want that smile!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Just the memory of your childhood is enough to send a warm feeling of joy, and before you know Nat's already clicking away.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"THAT'S the one! Great! Just keep that, and turn your head a bit to the right…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow! Just look at those! I can barely believe it's me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You are genuinely surprised as you see your own pictures - you never really thought you could actually pull it off - but looking at it, you can actually imagine yourself modeling!<br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"DAMN! I'd fuck me! Maybe I should start looking into modeling after all…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Whoa, Nelly, hold your horses! You look nice, but modeling is a lot more than just looking good for the camera."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Okay, but I'm not just looking good there, I'm basically ON FIRE! Can I get some copies of these? Maybe I should send them out to some agencies…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Nat grumbles, but says <<rivalI>>'ll forward you the pictures by email later.
<<elseif $shyConfident > -1>>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, what do you know, I guess I do make a pretty good teacher!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

<</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So… what are the pictures I took for?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"It's a gig I have coming up, they just needed a preview for their art director to organize the shoot."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"OHHHH, that's SO COOL! Can I come along?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Uh, I guess? It might be a bit boring though, it's a lot of waiting, and there's really not much to do in the meantime - and you need to stay off of everyone's toes. People can get pretty catty in modeling… everyone's a diva, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

Huh… you were expecting some fancy building in the office district, your mind bringing flashbacks of a fashion magazine like you saw in that movie. Instead, it seems like it's in a more run-down part of town? Weird!<br><br>
You make your way to the address, which is signaled by a bunch of trucks in front - probably the crew and their equipment and props… parked in front of an abandoned car mechanic shop? It's really not what you expected.<br><br>
You go in and find the hubbub of dozens of members of the crew buzzing like bees everywhere. You try to be discreet as you make your way through all the chaos, where they are setting up around a very modern and expensive-looking car. You eventually spot Nat, sitting down on a chair, a make-up artist working on <<rivalMy>> <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>bare<<else>>exposed<</if>> torso.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, there, Nat! Am I interrupting?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
It's very weird, they are applying regular make-up, but also painting very dramatic black smears that look like axle grease all over <<rivalMy>> body.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Hey, <<print $playerFirstName>>. No, no worries, the make up takes a bit, and I really don't have much to do, so I could use the company."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Nat introduces you to the make-up girl and some other members of the team, who are very nice to you, despite being clearly very busy.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I have to say, I never expected there would be these many people in a photo shoot - and certainly not this much work!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Oh, it varies, but this is a big deal - they are unveiling this high-end car prototype in a fashion magazine - it's all very hush-hush, so they had to do it somewhere inconspicuous. But at the same time, there's a lot of money riding on this one - it's going to be great for my career! It could very well be my big break!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, that's VERY exciting! Thanks for inviting me over!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You are offered a chair, but the energy there is so electric you kind have to keep standing - you can barely stand still as is, watching as dozens of different people set up lights, prepare the set, coordinate with other departments and clients - and there's also a very generous and tasty-looking catering service which makes your stomach rumble. You never thought modeling could be so cool and exciting!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"<<rivalName>>, darling, have you tried the jumpsuit yet? The photographer would like to have a look!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
This very nicely-dressed woman walks into the make-up station, holding a big folder and a clipboard in her hand, and an earpiece in her ear.<br><br>

<<else>>
    <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"Well, you didn't tell me you were going to bring your girlfriend to the shoot."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You and Nat quickly dismiss the notion that you are dating, in a clumsy and embarrassed fashion. It's actually kinda cute.<br><br><<set $flag.natModelPath to false>>
<</if>>

<<if $flag.natModelPath>>
    <<rivalName>> seems to fidget on <<rivalMy>> seat from this development, which is quite a difference from <<rivalMy>> complete peace before. The art director continues to appraise you and even take some candid shots with her phone as she mumbles to herself and takes notes. This feels a bit weird, to be sincere… but you don't want to be any more disruptive of this environment you've been invited to.<br><br>
    Soon the wardrobe girl comes back with an enormous frayed denim jumpsuit. 
    <<if $height >= 180 && $fat <=20 && $skills[4].level > 2 && $shyConfident > 1>>
    Before you can properly react, she's taking off your <<print outfit.top().name>> and <<print outfit.bottom().name>>, which leads the art director to just gasp at your alluring aura. Before handing you the jumpsuit, she has you giving a walk and a spin in your underwear. And without hesitation, you do it and just KILL IT. She's in pure awe of your presence, and won't shut up about your “It” factor.<br><br>
    You nab the jumpsuit from the wardrobe girl, and find yourself donning it in a sexy fashion almost instinctively - keeping the front open.
    <<elseif $muscle >= 50 && $breasts >= 45 && $fat <=25>>
    Before you can properly react, she's taking off your <<print outfit.top().name>> and <<print outfit.bottom().name>> (which, incidentally, makes the art director stare at you even more, and even give some of your muscles a quick rub of admiration), and trying to put on the jumpsuit.<br><br>
    <<elseif $muscle >= 35 && $breasts >= 40 && $height >= 185 && $fat <=25 >>
    Before you can properly react, she's taking off your <<print outfit.top().name>> and <<print outfit.bottom().name>> (a process the art director watches intently, amazed at your figure and fitness), and trying to put on the jumpsuit.<br><br>
    <<elseif $hipsSize >= 50 && $breasts >= 40 && $height >= 180 && $fat <=25 >>
    Before you can properly react, she's taking off your <<print outfit.top().name>> and <<print outfit.bottom().name>> (a process the art director watches intently, amazed at your incredibly alluring female figure), and trying to put on the jumpsuit.<br><br>
    <</if>>
    The process turns out to be more involved than you expected. Their plan is to keep the front zipper open, so she needs to carefully tape both sides to your shoulders and breasts - you never expected this to be a thing, but the wardrobe girl explains they do it all the time. <<if $muscle > 65>>She also discovers that any hope of getting your gigantic arms through the sleeves might be impossible. Since you notice that they are going for the frayed look anyway, with the entire piece being carefully weathered all over, you ask for their permission and just rip both sleeves away like they were made of paper (which makes the wardrobe girl gasp and get flushed).<</if>><br><br>
    As you finally get the jumpsuit on, the art director goes nuts, taking several pictures on her phone and saying a bunch of things out loud that you assume to be compliments, but you can't decipher more than half of them. You look at yourself in the mirror - and, boy, do you look HOT!
    One person from the make-up team stops working on Nat to work on you, which clearly irritates <<rivalMe>>, as they seat you by <<rivalMy>> side.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, I am not taking ‘no' for an answer, you MUST feature in this shoot with Nat. The two of you will look GORGEOUS. I will match <<rivalMy>> salary if I have to, and will have a contract in here for you to sign shortly."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Well, that escalated quickly. Things literally flash before your eyes, and when you finally realize what just happened, you and Nat are posing in front of the car.
    <<if $skills[4].level > 2 && $shyConfident > 1>>
    Somehow, you feel right at home, and without putting any effort, you find yourself in the sexiest poses you could possibly imagine. The camera just naturally gravitates towards you all the time, which makes Nat increasingly irritated as you quickly become the focus of the shoot instead of <<rivalMe>>, who is now playing second fiddle.<<set $flag.natNa6route = 1>>
    <<elseif $muscle >= 50 || $breasts >= 40 || $height >= 180 || $hipsSize >= 50>>
    It takes a little bit for you to figure it out, but with the help of the amazing photographer and director, you quickly find out that your physical gifts allow you to stand just as prominently in the shoot as Nat. They alternate between the two of you, emphasizing each one's best assets. The director makes it a point to have you interact with each other <<if $shyConfident >1>> and the chemistry is instantaneous, resulting in very tantalizing poses that make everyone there drool.<<else>> despite it making you a bit uncomfortable - but Nat is so professional that <<rivalI>> manages to make it work.<</if>><<set $flag.natNa6route = 2>>
    <<elseif $shyConfident < 0 && $skills[4].level < 2>>
    You try your hardest, but despite your good looks, actually being in a revealing outfit in front of so many people makes you pretty uncomfortable. Nat is forced to pick up the slack, which <<rivalI>> does effortlessly and magnifically: you end up being sort of background window dressing to <<rivalMy>> starring role in the shoot - which suits you well enough. At times, the director has the two of you interacting directly with one another, which makes you very thankful for the heavy make-up, because you suspect your cheeks might be PURPLE under all that as they pose you rubbing <<rivalMy>> <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>muscular chest<<else>>prominent abs and forearms<</if>>.<<set $flag.natNa6route = 3>>
    <<else>>
    The shoot is an incredible experience - Nat shines as the star, and you just help prop <<rivalMe>> up with your own great assets. The photographer and director are much more demanding of <<rivalMe>>… obviously… but they take great care in using you in the background, and you realize working as a model IS indeed as hard as you expected, maybe even more so. Yet, you have fun doing it.<<set $flag.natNa6route = 3>>
    <</if>>
    <<if $muscle >= 75 && $shyConfident > 2>>
    As the shoot is coming to an end, the director asks for a last shot of Nat laying under the car, as you watch from over the hood. However, they realize they don't have enough clearance for a proper shot - so the assistant is called to bring in a jack to lift the car.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Actually… do you guys have the rest of the shot set up already?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    When the director confirms that they do, you decide to play a little bit.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, then, no need to go get the jack!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You reach under the shocks and just lift the entire front of the car, your shoulders and arms bulging to unbelievable proportions. It's really heavy and quite a bit of effort, but you make a point of making it look absolutely effortless, smiling at the camera.<br><br>
    The director literally spits her expensive soy latte as she immediately instructs the photographer to take as many shots as he can. After they are done, you put the car back down and the entire crew claps - which prompts you to make a few muscle poses and take a bow, which only makes them clap even longer and harder.
    <</if>>
    With the shooting done, the photographer and director come to congratulate the two of you.<br><br>
    
    <<if $flag.natNa6route === 1>>
        <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"So, <<print $playerFirstName>>, do you have an agent already? Because, if you don't, you MUST let me suggest someone - it's a SIN that you are not in this business professionally yet. Because I know I will be requesting you again…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Yeah, you were great."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        Nat says that rather unenthusiastically - probably just to please the director, you suspect. No matter, you feel like a million bucks right now.<br><br>
        The assistant proceeds to get your details for payment (and maybe even future gigs, you hope?) while they give Nat some feedback. <<rivalI>> just nods irritably, despite getting a lot of compliments.<br><br>
        As they are done, the two of you go back to the dressing area to put your street clothes back on and remove the make-up.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, Nat, I can't thank you enough - this was an amazing experience!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
        Nat grumbles.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I just wish it had been a more professional one, these guys were acting like amateurs today… I'm not thrilled."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really? I thought everyone was super-nice and worked very hard… uh, I guess I really don't know much about the business."<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Yeah, that goes without saying…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        You don't appreciate that indirect dig, but decide to let it go, Nat's clearly in a very sour mood.
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Nah, it's nothing. I really should be going. There's going to be some taping of the documentary soon, and I need to just dive into my training routine so I can be ready."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, that sounds cool too! Do let me know, I'd like to be there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Sure, whatever."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        Nat just finishes dressing up and leaves without saying another word. Huh.
    
    <<elseif $flag.natNa6route === 2>>
        <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"Wow, you two work great together. <<rivalName>>, does your agent also represent her? Because, if not, I would get them in touch - you two would make an incredible package deal!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Uh, I guess I could introduce them..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        The director proceeds to give feedback to you two, mostly complimenting your synergy and how well the session went. Nat seems uneasy at sharing the credit, but tries to do so as gracefully as <<rivalI>> can.<br><br>
        As they are done, the two of you go back to the dressing area to put your street clothes back on and remove the make-up.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, Nat, I can't thank you enough - this was an amazing experience!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"It was alright. I've been to better ones, though."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really? I thought everyone was super-nice and worked very hard… uh, I guess I really don't know much about the business."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, it wasn't as great as some other ones, I can assure you of that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<rivalI>> clearly is bothered, and you decide not to probe further.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, thanks for stopping by, but I really should be going. There's going to be some taping of the documentary soon, and I need to just dive into my training routine so I can be ready."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, that sounds cool too! Do let me know, I'd like to be there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Yeah, I'll drop you a line or something."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        Nat just finishes dressing up and leaves with a curt “bye”.
    
    <<else>> /* $flag.natNa6route === 3 */
        <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Art Director">>"See, <<print $playerFirstName>>, that's why we pay <<rivalName>> the big bucks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        You nod, proud of your friend, who gladly accepts the praise. The director proceeds to give feedback, mostly positive, and reinforcing just how good Nat is at <<rivalMy>> job. It's a joy to see, really, and you find yourself learning a lot from it.<br><br>
        As they are done, the two of you go back to the dressing area to put your street clothes back on and remove the make-up.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, Nat, I can't thank you enough - this was an amazing experience!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"It was fun, right? I'm glad you could participate! Believe me, this doesn't happen everyday."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
        The two of you share your favorite moments among laughs, and it makes you miss the time you spent with Nat when you were kids. There was something magical about your friendship, and the feeling of nostalgia and satisfaction is just amazing.<br><br>
        <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, that was awesome and all, but I really should be going. There's going to be some taping of the documentary soon, and I need to just dive into my training routine so I can be ready."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

        Nat just finishes dressing up and gives you a warm hug before leaving.
    <</if>>
    With a nice unexpected paycheck in hand, you head back home.
<<else>>
    A small girl comes running, bringing a ragged denim jumpsuit. Done with <<rivalMy>> make-up, Nat gets up and sheds <<rivalMy>> half-worn robe, revealing to be wearing only a <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>pair of swimming trunks<<else>>tiny bikini underneath<</if>>. <<if $shyConfident < 0 >>You look away, blushing, while they help <<rivalMe>> don the jumpsuit… but sneak a peek anyway at 
    <<else>>You just stare as they help <<rivalMe>> don the jumpsuit, admiring <</if>>
    his amazing physique - which the wardrobe girl keeps just barely held by tape on <<rivalMy>> shoulders, making <<rivalMy>> <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>his muscular pectorals<<else>>nice cleavage<</if>> and abs stay in full display. She proceeds to roll up the sleeves, which get very tight around <<rivalMy>> ripped upper arms. Now in context, the fake grease marks make Nat looks especially hot with that “down to business mechanic” look - and you seriously doubt that anyone will be able to pay attention to any vehicles with <<rivalMe>> around.<br><br>
    One of the assistants gets you a chair (which was very nice of him), as you spend the next few hours just watching as everyone sets up several shots of Nat around the car. Looking seductively under the hood, changing tires, going under the vehicle on a sliding platform, reaching up on the car raised on a hydraulic lift… you never suspected fixing a car could be so hot - and you were clearly wrong.<br><br>
    Eventually, the director and photographer are both satisfied, and someone brings some towels for Nat to clean <<rivalMy>>self up. You roll your tongue back into its place, and go congratulate <<rivalMe>>.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Damn, Nat, that was impressive!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I thought you'd find it a bit boring… it's quite a long time to just watch a bunch of people taking a handful of pictures..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<if $shyConfident > 1 >>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, not when you have a literal <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>Adonis<<else>>Aphrodite<</if>> basically ripping out of a wide-open tattered jumpsuit - even with all this grease I want to lick every exposed part of your body!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<rivalName>> laughs, amused.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, not to dismiss all that effort I put in my body, but wardrobe and make-up did help bring out my best features, I won't deny…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<rivalI>> gives you a nice biceps flex, and one of the frayed parts around the shoulder rips right open - which you take as an invitation to just squeeze <<rivalMy>>bulging arm.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess it's a good thing this is not a photoshoot in a public place - you'd need a security detail to keep your fans away!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<else>>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, let's just say that the subject was not hard on the eyes… so that helped."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do give yourself some credit, though…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    “Because you look HOT AS FUCK!” you think internally, being extra-careful not to say it out loud.<br><br>
    <</if>>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Well, I do need to return the costume and clean up… so… if you don't mind - you don't need to wait for me. I can call you some other time."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You actually wouldn't mind waiting for <<rivalMe>>… but you already feel like you imposed enough.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Look, <<print $playerFirstName>>, I do need to put in a lot of training for the bodybuilding contest, so I don't know when we'll be able to meet again - but if you want, they said they'd be scheduling a taping sometime soon… I can give you a ring so you can come watch… if you are interested, that is."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You had me at “bodybuilding”... I mean… yeah, that sounds great!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You say your goodbyes, and find yourself looking forward to that next call.

You can hear the noise from inside <<rivalMy>>apartment, and after knocking, the door is opened by Nat's modeling agent - who immediately introduces herself and proceeds to shower you in praise as she gives you her business card and ushers you in.<br><br>
The commotion is not quite as big as during the modeling shoot, but despite the crew of three, you are amazed at the whole lighting and sound setup. You stay in the corner as they work, and Nat comes out from <<rivalMy>> bedroom, wearing a very sporty but fashionable outfit that hugs <<rivalMy>> excellent form quite tightly.<br><br>
You wave at <<rivalMe>>, and <<rivalI>> does a double-take, as if <<rivalI>>doesn't want to acknowledge your presence, then sighs and comes over, looking somewhat irritated.<br><br>

But, by the same logic, you can't really argue against my talent for this, all the progress I've made in a short time. I really hoped you'd be more supportive!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <</if>>
            Everyone else goes silent at the little spat between you and <<rivalName>> - who looks downright irritated at your response. <<rivalMy>> frown tries unsuccessfully to hide his anger, and you can see <<rivalMy>> mind is trying to figure out a way to make you change your mind.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I made my mind - and I'd like this to be a friendly competition. We can do that, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Nat sighs, rolls <<rivalMy>> eyes, and offers <<rivalMy>> hand, still unable to quite mask <<rivalMy>> frustration. You shake <<rivalMy>> hand, and feel as <<rivalMy>> squeezes yours with all her strength.<br><br>
            <<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>
            Without even blinking, you also squeeze it back - enough not to do any damage, but more than enough to show <<rivalMe>> who's the strongest. Your smile fades as you do so, looking deep into his eyes and asserting dominance in a way you didn't even know you had it in you. From the surprise in <<rivalMy>> eyes, you are pretty sure the message came across loud and clear.<br><br>
            <<elseif $submissiveDominant > -1>>
            You give <<rivalMe>> a firm squeeze, using a tiny fraction of your strength so as to let <<rivalMe>> have this Pyrrhic victory, knowing it just fuels your passion to grow even bigger and stronger. <<rivalI>> might just regret pushing you like this…<br><br>
            <<else>>
            Despite having enough muscle on your palm to probably be able to snap <<rivalMy>> arm, you feel quite intimidated by <<rivalMy>> assertion of dominance, and you wince - not from the non-existing pain from <<rivalMy>> squeezing, but from seeing your childhood friend treating you like this. Worse, <<rivalI>> seems to delight in doing it to you, which hurts more than any physical pain.

You said you had the whole day today…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Nat grunts as they sit you down in the chair. It would seem that getting <<rivalMy>> upstaged like this might change the way <<rivalI>> sees you in the long run…

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, actually, I have an idea… why don't we tackle this as partners?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Nat seems confused by your proposal, but you can notice the director's eyes are already sparkling with the idea.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Think about it - Nat has the experience, I apparently have some natural talent or good genetics or whatever… why don't the two of us get treated as partners in the documentary? It makes for some good storytelling, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            At this point, the director is just about giggling with excitement. Nat, on the other hand, seems a bit resentful of being upstaged like that.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I suppose you would have a chance at the competition… and you DO need someone with experience to help you figure out how to do this. I GUESS it wouldn't hurt to help you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Before you know it, both the director and Nat's agent are already making all kinds of plans for the two of you. They bring in a second chair and make preparations to film while you and Nat discuss how this partnership will work. You can't help but feel like <<rivalI>>'s not quite all in on the plan, but isn't about to state <<rivalMy>> opinions in front of everyone.<br><br>
            For now, it will be fun to tackle this challenge together… or at least, you hope so.

            <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"She's not wrong, you know? Bodybuilding is so much more than just having big muscles.

            <<if $skills[0].level > 2 && $skills[1].level > 2 && $skills[4].level > 1>>
            “Oh, EXCUSE ME, Nat… you think I just SPROUTED these muscles overnight?” You think to yourself. I mean, yeah, you kinda did… but there's also a lot of effort and study that went into it. “I hope you realize the beast you are awakening here…” you think, as you envision yourself as a mountainous competitor, a skimpy bikini revealing obscenely defined muscles - the veritable definition of HUGE. You KNOW you have the potential - and <<rivalI>> may just have given you the motivation you needed to go even further beyond.<br><br>
            Just you wait, Nat… just you wait.
            <<else>>
            It IS a bit demeaning, <<rivalMy>> implication that you would be unable to do so, but it is true that you kind of just fell into this whole thing quite suddenly. But now this question lingers in your mind - what COULD you achieve if you actually put the effort in? Taking into consideration the road so far, it sparks the imagination - if only you actually studied more about training, nutrition and posing…<br><br>
            You snap out of it, as <<rivalName>> sits down and starts giving <<rivalMy>> testimonial. You watch, wondering what it would be like if that was you on that seat…

<<if $krisOpinion > 0>>Well, <<rivalI>> clearly hasn't met Kris yet…<<else>>That sounds like a nice plan!<</if>><br><br>
You could use a little caffeine right now, and so you make your way to the mall.<br><br>
You arrive at the Coffee Corner before Nat, and get yourself a table for two. While you go through the menu, you see your old friend rushing in.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Sorry for my tardiness… got caught up in a silly phone call with my agent."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, no biggie. Work comes first, I know how it goes."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Yeah, yeah… nice weather, though… glad to be out of the house."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $natOpinion < 0>>Nat seems a bit uneasy, this kind of small talk isn't quite <<rivalMy>> style. It doesn't take long for <<rivalMe>> to spill the beans.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Still… the reason I called you… is that I wanted to apologize for my behavior lately. I haven't been the greatest friend, but I've been under a lot of stress and I feel like I ended up just dumping all of that on you. So… I'm sorry."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    That's more in line with the Nat you remember from your childhood. Yeah, <<rivalI>> was always on the impulsive side, but you remember <<rivalMy>> strong sense of justice… and <<rivalI>> must have felt bad for the stuff that happened.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, the important part is that you realize that what you did was not cool. I know life can get crazy… just… don't let it happen again, alright? I know you are not a jerk - but everyone else might not think the same way."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Nat smiles and thanks you, as a server approaches to take your orders.<br><br>
<<else>>
    Nat seems a bit distracted and unfocused, which you didn't quite expect.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is everything okay? You seem a little… off?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Ah, you know how it goes - I get a little too focused on my goals, and it throws me off-balance. I can get easily irritated or just overly pensive. That's why I invited you for coffee, you tend to help balance me - I don't have many people I would call “friends” here… in fact, I'd say you really are the only one."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    Awwww, that's sweet. Part of you just wants to smoosh <<rivalMy>>, but that might be a little forward on your part right now. As you ponder on that, Nat goes ahead and orders a couple of iced coffees. <<RivalI>> proceeds to tell you about how stressed <<rivalI>> is with the upcoming contest:<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"You know, despite all my martial arts training, I've always struggled a bit with anxiety - and that ticking clock for the contest is taking a toll. I feel like I need to squeeze every bit possible from each workout, worry about every single carb I consume… I'm just… constantly policing myself."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, but do you enjoy the process?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"The workouts, for sure. I feel the pressure to perform, but the training itself has always been very therapeutic for me - I'd say even more so the results…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<rivalI>> flexes <<rivalMy>> biceps, as to illustrate the point. You can't help but appreciate the very sharp peak on <<rivalMy>> arm, which gives <<rivalMy>> a very aesthetically pleasing shape.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"It probably sounds silly, but seeing the change on the numbers on the scale, the measuring tape, on the weights… it means I'm going forward. So every time I plateau, it's a bit unnerving - nerve-wracking, even."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You think for a bit. Maybe there's a way you can help <<rivalMe>>…<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Maybe you just need to see this from another perspective. If you can get enjoyment of part of it, I wonder if there's a way you can just perceive it differently?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"How so?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, what if you had a training partner? Someone you could both have a friendly competition and just a companion? Someone else to share the burden with you, motivate you, and just be there for you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You see surprise in <<rivalMy>> eyes. Both of you know you are talking about yourself… but before <<rivalI>> can fully process that, in comes Kris with the order.<br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Sup, here are a couple of iced cof..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris suddenly flips off the slacker mode switch… uh oh…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Wait… I KNOW you. I've seen you featured in <<if $rivalGender === 'male'>>Men<<else>>Women<</if>>'s Super Fitness Magazine - <<rivalName>>, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris licks her lips and crumbles the order pad in her hand. Krishap incoming…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Did anyone ever tell you that your abs are the most delicious thing on this planet? If I could, I would use them for a pillow for the rest of my life - pity I have a washing machine at home, because if I had access to those washboards, I would do my laundry everyday."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She completes that thought with a wink. Nat is clearly not amused, but plays along with <<rivalMy>> celebrity.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Uh… do you… want an autograph or something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oops, I guess I crumbled my notepad, but I'd gladly sign MY NAME on your abs WITH MY TONGUE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<rivalName>> is now downright uncomfortable with the situation, and makes a point of making that clear.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I'm sorry, I don't mind dealing with fans, but I do demand we keep some boundaries - ESPECIALLY from people in the service industry while they are working!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<rivalName>> doesn't quite understand how Kris operates - this rant is only bound to get her more worked up!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Well, how about we service you then? Let me take a peek under the hood…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
QED.<br><br>
Kris just unapologetically lifts Nat's shirt, revealing <<rivalMy>> (unquestionably yummy) abs to the entire store. The usual clientele, quite accustomed to Kris, doesn't even bat an eye, but Nat <<rivalMy>>self seems to be surprised at that, and grabs the attendant by the wrist, apparently putting quite a bit of pressure on it.<br><br>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"HEY! HANDS OFF!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Unsurprisingly, this just seems to get Kris even more excited.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey… everyone… maybe we ought to de-escalate this whole situation?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
The look on both of their eyes is, frankly, a bit scary. Kris is laying down the thirst, and Nat seems to have an intense burning - not quite anger, but… intense, nonetheless. The Mexican standoff has now grabbed some attention from other people as the tension continues to climb.<br><br>
Time seems to freeze. The two trade looks, and you can't pry your own eyes from the situation, but also can't quite decide what to say. No one knows who is going to make the next move, and you can almost swear your heart has stopped in anticipation - at the very least, you know you are holding your breath.<br><br>
And then, completely unannounced, Kris just bends over and gives Nat a lick on the neck, <<rivalMy>> wrist still being held, and stands back up with a huge grin. Nat jerks back immediately, like <<rivalI>>'s been bitten by a rabid animal, and just grabs his iced coffee cup with <<rivalMy>> free hand and tosses the whole thing against Kris's face - the rigid plastic cup leaving a small red mark on her drenched face. Suddenly, all eyes on the store turn to watch the altercation.<br><br>
Complete silence. No one in the place moves a muscle - Kris's face dripping wet with iced coffee, and her demeanor is a bizarre mix of surprise, revolt and excitement.<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1 && $muscle >= 50>>
Without even blinking, you grab the free wrist that tossed the cup, which you remember being the one <<rivalI>> hurt from the day <<rivalI>> was bringing the sports equipment. You hold it quite tightly, and you can see some pain in Nat's face.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"She stepped out of line - but you just did the same, Nat."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
With the most decisive expression you might have ever put up in your entire life, you say the next phrase, carefully pronouncing each word clearly and slowly.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Let. Her. Go."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1>>
You stand up and move yourself between Nat and Kris, facing your old friend.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"She stepped out of line - but you just did the same, Nat."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
With the most decisive expression you might have ever put up in your entire life, you say the next phrase, carefully pronouncing each word clearly and slowly.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Let. Her. Go."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<else>>
This has officially gotten out of control. You are unsure how to deal with it. You stand up, and start trying to push the two apart.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"HEY! This has gone quite far. Let's break this up, right now!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
<<if $natOpinion > 0>>
    Nat seems to realize what <<rivalI>> just did, and you can see <<rivalI>> is shocked as it dawns on <<rivalMy>>. Letting go of Kris, <<rivalI>> apologizes profusely.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I-I'm… I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me - it's… just been a difficult day."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<if $submissiveDominant > 1 && $muscle >= 50>>You let go of <<rivalMy>> hand.<br><br><</if>>
    Kris quickly snaps back into her senses as well, but seems even more confused - she's probably not used to this kind of blowback to her advances, and seems to still be processing the whole ordeal. Either way - she just scurries back behind the counter, trying to figure whether she should be harboring contempt or arousal as she removes her wet apron.<br><br>
    <<rivalName>> is frankly not doing much better. <RrivalI>> lowers <<rivalMy>> face into <<rivalMy>> hands, eyes bugged out.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nat… I'm glad you apologized and I understand you are under a lot of stress… but you just acted like a little kid. "<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I… I…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<RivalI>> is struggling. You can see <<rivalI>> feels really guilty about it, and is trying to figure out his next step.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nat… I can't pretend to know what you are going through right now. But it seems like you may need some help."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<RivalI>> takes a deep breath before continuing.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I fought for so many years to earn people's respect… so many people doubted me - and just being a model, I get judged so much on my looks alone."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<RivalI>> is genuinely regretting the whole thing. You give <<rivalMe>> a hug.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I understand the pressure - but what you did is pretty awful. You talk about respect, and Kris did step over the line, but what you did was just as bad."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Trust me, I know. I… just need a second to decompress or something."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    You tell <<rivalMe>> to go home and get some rest. You make sure to check on Kris, but in typical fashion, she seems to already be lusting after someone else. Well, on the bright side, it seems like Nat has gotten a wake-up call about <<rivalMy>> behavior, and learned an important lesson about respect and self-control. The conversation about training with <<rivalMe>> will just have to wait for now.
<<else>>
    You are going to have to deal with this.

                You give Nat's wrist a very firm squeeze, and he winces. You aren't proud of it, but <<rivalI>> crossed a line by splashing her. <<RivalI>> lets go of Kris, and you do the same. Nat rubs <<rivalMy>> wrist.<br><br>
                <<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1>>
                You look very deeply into Nat's eyes, and no more words are needed - you look so intense that <<rivalI>> lets go of Kris, and you do the same to <<rivalMe>>.<br><br>

                Kris scurries to the back, and the manager starts to approach, but you tell him that you'll deal with this.<br><br>

                Nat grunts, still harboring feelings of self-righteousness over the whole episode. Unbelievable.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What if that hadn't been iced coffee, but hot?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Are you really going to take her side, despite of what she did to start the whole thing?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You find yourself raising your voice considerably.<br><br>

                This is just going in circles. You demand that <<rivalI>> apologizes, and <<rivalI>> very reluctantly agrees. <<RivalI>> stands up, walks up to Kris, who very uncharacteristically looks frozen as Nat approaches. <<rivalI>> blurts out a half-hearted apology, and Kris nods back, hints of contempt and lust adorning her reddened cheek.<br><br>
                You just roll your eyes. You expected more from Nat, and as you come back, you just glare in disbelief.<br><br>

                You huff in frustration, and decide it's best to walk out before you are the one doing something stupid. You are not in the mood to finish the conversation about training with <<rivalMe>>, but maybe you should pick that up later as an excuse to help <<rivalMy>> deal with <<rivalMy>> issues.

                The manager approaches, phone in hand and presumably calling the cops. You promise you have things under control, and <<rivalI>> steps back. Alright, <<print $playerFirstName>>, let's try to rein this whole thing in.<br><br>

                You give Nat a tight hug, and tell <<rivalMe>> to go back home and think about what <<rivalI>> did. <<RivalI>> leaves, thanking you one last time. You make a mental note to finish that conversation about joining <<rivalMy>> training some other time.

                The manager steps in, already calling the cops on the phone. You start freaking out, and Kris steps in and convinces him to hang up. The manager ends up confronting Nat, and you find yourself unable to intervene. The whole thing kind of just blows up as everyone starts shouting louder and louder, and you just leave the Coffee Corner without saying another word. That conversation about joining his training will just have to wait.

		content: `You make it to the mall for your chemistry class, and the address apparently was indeed right. As you approach Tasha’s Thrifts, you find the diminutive Tasha trying to accomplish an impossible task. The old lady is effortlessly pushing a large metallic apparatus in front of her store - revealing a wide smile and humming happily as if she’s making huge progress - but she’s just leaning her hands against it and stepping in place, as the heavy weight of the device completely stops her in her tracks.<br><br>
You approach her, still in disbelief that she is the mysterious chemistry tutor. Who would’ve guessed? She must be a retired professor from the college. But if this tutoring is to happen you will need to give her a hand first.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, Tasha, hello. Do you need a hand?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Without turning around, she just keeps pushing, and nonchalantly responds:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Just give me a second, dear, I’ll have this device back inside the classroom and I’ll help you after that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Yeah, this is going nowhere. So it’s time for you to roll up your sleeves and give her a hand. <<if $muscle>=60>>You grab the device by its convenient handles, and lift it, Tasha and all, with ease - thanks to your overdeveloped musculature, since the unrecognizable contraption must easily weigh more than <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>fifty kilos<<else>>a hundred pounds<</if>>.<<elseif $muscle>=40>>You politely ask Tasha to step aside for a second, and grabbing both handles, lift the weighty unknown contraption. It must weigh more than <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>fifty kilos<<else>>a hundred pounds<</if>>, but all your workouts have paid off, and with a little bit of effort, you bring it inside the store, Tasha following you close behind.<<elseif $muscle>=25>>This won’t be easy, but you request Tasha to move aside, and use the handles to tilt the barrel-like metallic contraption on its rim, allowing you to slowly (and with considerable effort, this thing has got to weigh over <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>fifty kilos<<else>>a hundred pounds<</if>>!) to get it inside the store.<<else>>As Tasha pushes it from behind, you grab both handles and pull it from the front. OOPH! It’s gotta weigh over <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>fifty kilos<<else>>a hundred pounds<</if>>!<</if>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Oh, just in time for class, dear. You can sit down now, class will start shortly."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Tasha moves behind the counter and grabs a piece of chalk, and starts drawing on the wall behind her - which is not a blackboard, but at least is dark enough to make it readable. She has kindly provided a small student chair with desk, which you immediately make use of.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Well, kids, today’s class is about one of the most basic procedures in chemistry, dating back to more than a thousand years before Christ. Yes, indeed, we were breaking down liquids through this incredible process so long ago we have tablets from Babylonians in Mesopotamia making use of it. Isn’t that amazing?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Wow, I guess you should give her more credit, she seems to really know what she’s talking about. She not only has your attention, you are downright mesmerized by what she has to say - she must have been an amazing professor back in the day. She makes everything easy to digest and captivates your attention effortlessly. You lean your chin against your hands as she continues her lecture.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"You see, the incredible thing about distillation is that it allows us to separate elements in a liquid mixture using simply evaporation and condensation. You see, different components have different boiling temperatures, and so, by using very controlled heating and cooling, we can make one part of a mixture be completely taken apart from the rest. Like so..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Tasha produces one of the metallic vials from her pocket. Wait, isn’t that...? Yeah, it’s one of the mysterious potions you’ve been seeing around the town!<br><br>
Tasha playfully open the device, and pours the liquid inside the barrel through one of its pipes. Then she reaches for one of its controls and starts raising the temperature, which is displayed on a digital readout. She goes on to explain how you can ascertain that there is some component changing its state from liquid to gas by watching how the temperature changes at a different pace once the boiling process has started. Your eyes widen as you watch the steam forming and little droplets appearing on one of the glass pipes. It’s like you are part of some sort of sci-fi story or something.<br><br>
The purple liquid she poured has turned a deep cerulean blue, and now there’s a red liquid on the glass vial at the end of the pipe. She unscrews the vial from the machine, and drops another liquid she had in her thermos, which results in a bizarre green solution - which she just gulps right in front of you.<br><br>
As Tasha laughs, she seems to tremble right before your eyes and you see the veins in her forehead, neck and hands growing right before your eyes, like she’s having some sort of vascular accident. You stand up immediatelly, startled and ready to carry her to the closest ER but...<br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"BURP! Ah, my cold brew coffee really hits the spot."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Yeah, that was no coffee, Tasha, but there’s probably no use trying to explain that to her. It’s so weird, though - whatever she did, it seems to have quite the effect on her. Her veins stand out more than ever, seems like it’s making her heart pump even stronger. You could swear she even seems more energetic.<br><br>
Wow, that’s a lot to digest. Wait. Does that mean you can manipulate these concoctions and create new effects? Your mind races as you realize the implications of all of this.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Tasha? How much do you want for that still?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Oh, this old thing? It’s property of the college. I’m sure you understand, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You slump, dejected. Surely it won’t be easy to find such an elaborate device on just any store...<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Three hundred dollars sounds good to you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You point your index fingers at her and just blurt out:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Just a moment, and I’ll get it for you!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>`

It still lingers in your mind, but you want to help, and the conversation about being <<rivalMy>> workout partner was left unfinished.

<<elseif $muscle >= 40>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You probably noticed, but I've been putting some meat on these bones lately, and I mostly work out by myself, so I thought - hey!

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So… I may not be quite on your level, but even if I'm only there for moral support, I feel like maybe… you know… you could use someone on your corner. See me as a cheerleader, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

There's a second of silence on the line.<br><br>
<<if $muscle >= 55>>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"I don't know. I'm very particular about my workout habits, it could be that I just end up not being able to get in the zone with you around."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You don't need to worry about that!

And it would be a pleasure to spend more time with you, Nat."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
That's just an offer <<rivalI>> cannot refuse - even if there was a hint of emotional blackmail there.<br><br>
<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, no need to worry about me getting in the way, I'll just be in my corner, doing my stuff… but I'll be available if you need me. And if you just happen to need a friendly shoulder to lean on… I'll be there. That's what friends are for."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Instead of laying it thick, you just go easy. There's no way <<rivalI>>'ll refuse that.<br><br>
<</if>>

<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"Maybe you are right. Maybe a workout companion might just be what I need.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah! I'll even bring some pompoms for the cheerleading!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say jokingly, but you totally see yourself doing that.<br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue setup.getRivalName() setup.getRivalName()>>"You win, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I'll drop a line, and you can come train with me. Just be aware: I go at it HARD.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No worries, you can leave all cheering and mollycoddling to me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You both give a good laugh. That's more in line with the kind of talk you used to have with Nat. You are looking forward to seeing <<rivalMe>> at the gym sometime soon.`

Once you get to the gym, you see Nat standing by the reception desk, already in <<rivalMy>> workout gear, talking to a small group of people.<br><br>

The little audience seems divided into people who are excited about you… and a few who seem to be jealous of your proximity with Nat.
