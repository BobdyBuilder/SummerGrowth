    content: '<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints to 0>>After a brief trip to the grocery store, you find yourself carrying two rather large shopping bags of ingredients. You follow the instructions to Emma’s apartment building, which is located on a fancy new bougie neighborhood. It’s a stark, modern building that kind of stands out - not unlike Emma herself.<br><br>You feel … out of place? Entering the ultraclean mirror-laden elevator. <<if $muscle >= 80>> It’s a bit of a struggle to even fit in, despite it being a larger-than-average elevator. You worry a bit about your bulging muscles potentially cracking the reflective surfaces as you fiddle to hit the 7th floor button, but fortunately you end up managing to do it uneventfully.<<elseif $muscle >= 45>> You are not used being surrounded by mirrors in such an enclosed space, and can’t help but appreciate your muscular build - no wonder people take so many elevator selfies!<<else>> That’s A LOT of mirror. Makes you feel a bit self-conscious, actually.<</if>> It’s almost the opposite of the rickety, dark stairs that lead into the musty basement apartment where you live. As you rise with it, it just make something weird tick in your brain, but you just can’t quite put a finger on it.<br><br>As the door opens, you find yourself heading to apartment 7A. The contrast just keeps piling up as you press the classy doorbell and a classical tune rings inside. You snort at the thought of the anxious door knocks you and Johan trade with each other back home. And before you stop daydreaming, the door opens, revealing a very slightly more casually dressed Emma - though you REALLY need to pay close attention to tell the difference: her hair is impeccable despite the early weekend hours, she has her usual discreet but perfectly applied make-up, and her clothes are just a smidge less formal than what she wears to the office. <<if ["professional", "stylish"].includes($outfit.style()) == false>>Actually, it makes you quite self-aware about your own attire, and you secretly wish you spent another hour getting dolled up this morning.<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints -= 1>><</if>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ah, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Please come in. Make yourself at home, I was just finishing my preparation here."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, excuse me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>As you step in, another shock. Emma’s apartment is both minimalist and elegant. It’s not HUGE, but still noticeably larger than your cheap student accommodation - in great part due to the clever two-story mezzanine layout. But it still makes you slightly uneasy to walk in and see all the light from the giant windows glistening on the plethora of bare surfaces. It’s almost like the polar opposite of your dark and messy abode.<br><br>Emma politely but quietly leads you into the kitchen. It’s got this super-snazzy brushed metal finish everywhere, with a fancy dark marble counter… where you find dozens of pre-prepared and pre-measured containers with ingredients laid out so neatly you’d think she used a ruler to set them up. Had you not known Emma, you’d think it was almost performative - but it just matches the entire vibe of the house to a T. It’s just a bit disconcerting, it feels like you walked into a studio production instead of someone’s house.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I finished weighing my ingredients and had my //mise en place// ready before you arrived to keep things efficient."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<if $skills[2].level > 3>>It takes actual effort not to let your jaw drop. So it’s early morning, and not only is she impeccably presentable, but also did all this work ahead. Does that woman even sleep? You shake your head, trying to rid your brain of the image of Emma in bed - which will not be conductive to your productivity.<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 3>><</else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I never ate mizenplah… is that a type of protein or something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma very politely clears her throat to disguise a giggle.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ahem. It’s French. A culinary terms, literally means ‘to put everything in place.’"<</Dialogue>>She waves her hand over the organized containers. You think twice about saying you thought it was an alien race from Stellar Trek, trying (very hard) not to look like a complete cultureless yokel in front of your boss.<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 1>><</if>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, Emma. This is beautiful."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You start awkwardly removing your ingredients from the bags you brought, trying to stave off the uncomfortable feeling of inadequacy as you put them on an empty section of the counter.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Here, let me help you. If you tell me how you want it portioned, I can organize yours as well."<</Dialogue>><<if $shyConfident > 2>>You watch as Emma grabs it, and you recite those proportions you have memorized by now. You are mesmerized, watching her admirable efficiency as she quickly repeats the process with your ingredients, making it seem absolutely effortless and still achieving a result that belonged in a professional culinary photoshoot. Whoa, that is… unexpectedly sexy.<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 3>><<elseif $shyConfident > 0>>Before you can say anything, Emma has taken control of the process. You stutter as you recite the memorized proportions, and in a mesmerized stupor, watch her admirable efficiency as she quickly repeats the process with your ingredients, making it seem absolutely effortless and still achieving a result that belonged in a professional culinary photoshoot. Whoa, why is that… so hot?<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 1>><<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nah, it’s okay!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You mutter, possessively curving yourself over your ingredients, in a silly and very unsuccessful attempt to defend your ego. With slightly shaky hands, you try to reproduce her whatchamacallit… but it comes out like a sorry attempt made by a kid trying to reproduce something professional. At least in your head, it looks even worse than it sounds.<</if>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Great! So, let me show where all my kitchen appliances and silverware are, and I’ll let you take the lead!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Well, time to roll some sleeves! <<if $muscle >= 80>>Though your ginormous arms actually make it easier for you to rip out of them than roll them!<<elseif $muscle >= 55>>Actually, that would be a very nice opportunity to show off your ripped arms, but maybe you want to keep things a bit more formal, it’s still Emma, after all.<<elseif $muscle >= 35>>I mean, you would just as well want to give your own budding biceps a bit deserved appreciation even if you weren’t about to get your hands dirty!<</if>><<if $carefreeCarefull > 2>>In keeping with vibe, you lay out your tools like everything else, and ensure to ask Emma about her nutritional goals. With that taken care of, you proceed to very carefully explain every step of the process, and sprinkle a few culinary curiosities while you demonstrate how to do it.<br><br>Time flies as the two of you do your prep side-by-side, Emma attentively watching and reproducing your every movement with expert precision - you’d swear she’d done the same thing thousands of times before, if not for the fact that her eyes are constantly over you. Actually, that makes you feel warm and tingly inside. This is an unusual flipping of your roles, and makes you feel appreciated, maybe even… admired?<br><br>Before you know it, there’s two piles of neatly packed meals. Wow. And you managed to keep the mess to a minimum to boot!<<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 3>><<elseif $carefreeCarefull > 0>>You try to plan a bit ahead, looking around and trying to anticipate how you are going to tackle this. You hesitate a few times, but mostly try to keep it simple and clear as you demonstrate the process for Emma. She nods and occasionally lets out the occasional communicative ‘hmm’ to assure you she got it or found something educational. There’s an occasional fumble or two, but this time Emma is acting as your assistant, and you could almost swear she can read your mind as she seems one step ahead in offering the proper tool or ingredient - making you almost feel like a surgeon! Heh!<br><br>Before you know it, the two of you found a nice groove, and things get a bit less stuffy. Her attention is still fully dedicated to you, but you manage somehow to make some small talk, and the process unfolds quite pleasantly. It is almost with regret that you close the lid on the last packed meal, proud that you managed to keep Emma’s kitchen in a relatively clean state!   <<set $emmaMealPrepPoints += 1>><<else>>Alright, so there’s A LOT of stuff. You find yourself constantly stopping to figure out where something is, and trying not to get even more frustrated as you explain to Emma each step in the process. You try not to let it bother you that she is somewhat quiet, telling yourself that it’s just the way she is. Yet… you can’t help but feel almost like she’s judging you. But you press ahead, your culinary skills shining despite the clutter you are generating in the process.<br><br>It’s slightly unnerving to see Emma splitting her time between reproducing your instructions and trying to clean up after your mess. But you suck it up and barrel on. If Emma is bothered, she is not letting it past her ironclad expression of attention and interest.<br><br>And so, after quite a bit of work, there are two piles of packaged meal, ready to be frozen. True, Emma’s look a lot neater, and you wish the kitchen wasn’t in such disarray. But all in all, it’s still a victory. <<set $emmaMealPrepPoints -= 3>><</if>><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, I certainly learned a lot. And I must admit, whatever I tasted was so much better - I still can’t believe you managed to make the chicken so juicy!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<if  $emmaMealPrepPoints >= 5>>With a proud smile, you put your hands on your hips and nod.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I couldn’t possibly ask for a better student. In fact, I can confidently say I learned a thing or two on how to make the process more efficient from you!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma proceeds to store her meals neatly in her freezer as you set yours back in your bag. You can’t help but appreciate the smile you brought to her oft-cold face. It’s hard to explain, but there’s something… different… about Emma outside the office. It’s a unique levity that manifests in brief content smiles instead of just smirks that reek of superiority. Before you know it, you find that your heart is racing a bit.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Wow, look at the time! I guess you ARE right, time does fly by when you have company, this is much more efficient than doing it by yourself."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I think the word you are looking for is ‘fun,’ though!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma blinks, in a genuine, albeit rare, display of surprise.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I suppose it is. Fun is not the usual yardstick I measure things with, but maybe I should rethink that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>A million thoughts cross your mind. You want to act on every single one of them, and yet, part of you hesitates… at least until you see that there’s still an open container of spelt flour on the sink. With a completely straight face, you grab some in your hand and turn to Emma.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Emma?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Yes?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And then you blow the flour on her face, covering her glasses and messing up her perfectly coiffed hair. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Maybe some flour will help you loosen up, like we did with that dough?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Despite the fact you can’t see her eyes, you feel her instantaneous moment of utter disbelief and shock. Uh oh. You acted a bit too impetuously, and you expect her to get really mad…<br><br>But instead, she takes a deep breath and, despite having decreased visibility, she just digs her hand in the cocoa powder and smudges your entire face.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Two can play at this game, Ms. <<print $playerLastName>>."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your entire face is brown with the powder, and you start coughing.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And I’m not sure you are quite ready to face my competitive side head-on!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You both laugh, and it’s amazing how much the two of you relax after the silly duel. Part of you wants to get into a full water fight, but you don’t want to mess her apartment that much. Still, as you both clean your respective faces, you feel a little closer to her, which is no small feat given that Emma tends to keep people at arm’s length.<br><br>Emma insists on paying you for all ingredients, and no matter how much you protest, she gets her way - as is usual. After settling accounts, she leads you to the door, where a quick awkward moment ensues: you feel like hugging her, slightly opening your arms, but as you watch Emma’s eyes widen, you quickly switch to a more formal handshake. Still, you can SWEAR there’s regret in her expression. Well, too late for that. You say your goodbyes and head back home.’  <<if $emmaMealPrepPoints <= 5>>And then it hits you like a train. Before you know, a single tear rolls down your cheek as you courageously keep yourself from sobbing. This whole experience, the constantly nagging feeling, you finally understand what’s been bothering you so much: Emma and you couldn’t be bigger polar opposites. She’s WAY out of your league, and you could NEVER reach her level. Who are you trying to fool? The answer is yourself, because SHE would never believe that!<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, are you okay?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You try to discreetly wipe your moist cheek and put on a brave smile while you shove all these feelings of inadequacy under the rug.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Me? PFFFFT! Never better!!! I mean, how could I with such a great disciple?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>That last word makes you wish you had bitten your tongue. You look at the time, and quickly start making up excuses to get out of there ASAP. Emma wants to settle accounts, but you just want to rush out of there as fast as you can.<br><br><<if $emmaOpinion > 30>>But before you can, Emma grabs you by the wrist with her firm hand. Her face displays concern but doesn’t lose one iota of her trademark fierceness. It’s so reassuring it just breaks you up entirely from the inside, and before you know, you are sobbing loudly, eyes puffy and tears drenched in tears.<br><br>Great, that’s going to leave an even better impression on her.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>When you gather the courage to raise your eyes and look in her face, you don’t find the contempt you were expecting. No, Emma is looking at you like a concerned mother.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m *sob* sorry. I’m just… gosh, you must think I’m a mess! I’ll just be going, I apologize for being such a mess…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma tilts her head in utter confusion.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, I am not sure what I’ve done to give you any impression that I was displeased, but that is completely unfounded. I am very grateful for your help. But… I’m also… concerned. What is troubling you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You take a deep breath and briefly consider a white lie, but you owe Emma the truth. Well, here goes!<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I… I look up to you, Emma. A lot. You are like, goals, you know? But coming here? It’s like this huge wake-up call telling me just how inadequate I am, I could never dream of reaching your level. It’s just… heh… me being silly, nothing for you to worry about."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You make ready to leave, but Emma puts on that piercing smirk and motions for you to wait. She hurries up to the mezzanine where you assume her bedroom must be, leaving you very confused.<br><br>When she comes down, she has a photo frame in her hand. She looks at you, that stern edge there again, as she reveals a picture of this wiry, pimply, awkward teen at the park. Wait a second, she looks familiar.<br><br>No way.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You know, all of us can be a bit of an ugly duckling…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your heart skips a beat. You know the tale well, and somehow with just a picture and a handful of words, she sets everything right, like any good mother would do. You find your breathing settling and your composure returning.<br><br>Emma smiles at you, and gives you a warm hug. You hug her back, feeling her solid frame which makes you feel incredibly safe and cared for<if $muscle >= 55>>, even if you might actually be considerably beefier than her!<</if>>.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You breathe a word of this to anyone in the office and I’ll eat your liver for breakfast."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You both laugh, and you assure her that her secret is safe with you. Emma goes for her wallet and pays you for the ingredients as she leads you out, arm wrapped around your shoulder.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"We all struggle. It’s what makes us stronger. But we seldomly get to see what others had to go through. My point is: don’t doubt yourself - you are a lot stronger than you believe."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You smile and nod. You came here to teach her, but in the end, it seems like Emma couldn’t quite relinquish her seniority. Heh. Typical.<br><br>After a brief but awkward silence, you say your goodbyes, and head to the elevator, meals in hand. You are so lucky to have Emma as your boss, you can barely believe it. But you also kind of want your relationship to take the next step…’<<else>>And so you end up tossing your meals in a bag and running to the door and letting yourself out as Emma shouts she’ll transfer you the money directly to your account. You never turn to look back as you enter the elevator.’<</if>><</if>><<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>>'

    content: 'Humans are creatures of habit and routine. This quotation applies to most people - and thus includes you as well. Usually, when you go to the office, you tend to take the elevator because the office is on the tenth floor and the lift is very convenient compared to the stairs. Today is no different, and you walk towards the elevator with every intention of using it. However, as you look at the automatic doors, you notice something new. Since you\'ve grown A LOT, the elevator is... a bit too small for someone of your size. What\'s more, you notice that Emma is standing in the back of the elevator, she doesn\'t even notice you because she\'s wearing earbuds and looks to be lost in thought reading a file. Still, you are no quitter, and you force your body through the door as the carriage grates and groans in protest. <br><br>Emma lifts her head, confronted by a literal wall of muscles coming her way, which pushes her even further into the corner. She lets out an indignant grunt, but there is nothing she can do to resist the sheer weight of your body, and it seems that she\'s now trapped under your immense bulk.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Hey!

If you keep at it, I\'m not going to be able to breathe!"<</Dialogue>><br>Ugh, Party pooper. You stifle a giggle, but relax your muscles. Emma\'s face is red as she gives you a sharp look. You grin a little, noticing that she looks pretty cute when embarrassed. However, your fun is cut short as a soft DING is heard from the elevator, which arrived at the tenth floor where the office is located.

In any case, she isn\'t able push the issue any further, as the elevator doors open, signaling the end of your journey. After getting out, you both exit and walk towards your respective desks.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"...Ahem."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You turn your cheap office swiveling chair without thinking, and find your boss, Emma, looking rather stern as usual. But also… something is slightly off? But you can’t quite put a finger on what exactly - she seems unusually hesitant?<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ms. <<print $playerLastName>>, I hope I’m not interrupting."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Not at all! Shoot!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma is momentarily taken aback by your informal response, as betrayed by her raising right eyebrow. But she recomposes herself almost immediately, raising her glasses with a decisive finger and a brief frown.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I apologize for intruding during your work, but I had a… personal request I’d like to make."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You tilt your head to the side inquisitively, still a bit confused. An awkward silence follows, until Emma realizes you are just waiting for her to spill the beans.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ahem! Well, I will cut right to the chase: I do my meal prep work every other week, and after witnessing your culinary prowess, I was wondering if you could come over and help me, as well as give me some pointers?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You blink, incredulously. Is this the same Emma that you are used to? For most people that request would sound normal, but you just know how big of a leap that is for Ms. Super Formal. Emma rarely mixes work and personal life, and you are immediately honored by the request.<br><br>

            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I… I have a freezer where I keep my ingredients. It would only make sense for you to come over, I can guarantee my kitchen is fully supplied with all major implements and spices."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            Emma, again, finds herself hesitating. You quickly realize that she still views this as some kind of transaction, and you might have gone a bit too friendly for her comfort zone.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ll bring the receipts, we can settle the accounts at the end. Or, better yet, why don’t I bring my own stuff, and we can do both our preps, and I’ll show you all my tricks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            Emma’s lips purse almost imperceptibly, but she takes a big breath and nods.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I suppose that is true. Agreed. I’ll text you my address later. Would this coming saturday, at 8 in the morning work for you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

    content: `Today is the big day for the office-wide meeting at the office, when Emma is supposed to address all the cuts from the meeting at HQ. You’d be lying if you said your stomach wasn’t doing a whole gymnastics routine - the dread alone is making you nauseous, but you also feel bad for Emma, this must be pretty tough on her. Still, you expect her to keep her cool and just get the news across, even if it will make everyone lash back at her.

But as you get to the office, something is just off. Everyone seems a bit on edge, which is expected with such a branch-wide meeting, but this is something else. It does not take long to figure it out: Emma is nowhere to be found, and won’t answer her phone! This, by itself, is kind of unprecedent... and now that you think about it, she’s just been a bit off lately. Your concern starts escalating, and now you’ve taken upon yourself to figure out what is wrong.

<<if setup.hasEventBeenTriggered("emmaMealPrep")>>Thankfully, you know Emma’s address from when you went there to prep meals, so you let HR know that you have a personal emergency and take the day off to check on her.

<<else>>
<<if $skills[2].level > 3>>With no time to lose, you log into a terminal and, knowing the quirks of the system, you game the options to get access to Emma’s address, and you send a message to HR to get a day off due to a personal emergency - and off you go to check on her.
 
<<elseif $shyConfident > 1 || $muscle >55 || $height > 200>>You feel like someone ought to check on Emma, but first you need to figure how to reach her. The fastest way is to get it from HR - and so you just corner the meek employee from that department and intimidate him into giving you Emma’s address - you don’t feel great about it, but it’s for a good cause... right?

<<else>>You can’t just leave Emma like this. But if she’s not answering her phone, what else can you do? Maybe you can figure out her address? But how?

You go over all the usual things you can figure out - looking in the internal employee database, but you have no access. HR says it can’t disclose that information due to privacy concerns. ARGH! How can you find such information?

You look at Emma’s office... the janitor does have the keys to all doors, which he keeps leaving unattended on his cart! You swipe those, and discreetly unlock the door to her office, sneaking inside. You don’t want to pry into her personal stuff too much - but you luck out right away: her inbox has a receipt for her dry cleaning - complete with her address! And it’s off to the races!

Leaving the office, you make your way to the apartment building. You hurry up the stairs to Emma’s apartment, and knock on the door. You hear a pained groan, and your heart sinks - that’s clearly Emma’s voice!

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ugh. Just a second..."<</Dialogue>>

You hear some shuffling, and the lock clicks, before opening. Your shock only increases when you see a very tired and disheveled Emma, still in workout clothes, her half-open eyes trying to focus on you - and it takes her a few seconds to even process who you are.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Emma - are you okay? The entire office is worried about you!"<</Dialogue>>

Emma is hot and clammy, running a fever under all that sweat. She moans and occasionally talks about reports, cost cutting and efficiencies, but she’s very clearly delirious. You place a hand on her wet forehead, and she’s burning up! You run to get a wet towel on her forehead, and pull a chair by her side. You’d never even entertained the thought you’d ever be truly concerned about Emma, she seems so strong and self-sufficient, seeing her like this is disturbing. But right now, all you feel you can do is give her support, so you grab some orange juice in the fridge and sit by her side, holding her hand.

She clearly takes a lot of care of her nails and palms - while she doesn’t keep her nails very long, they are discreetly yet meticulously painted, with her palms being very moisturized, but also roughened with the calluses of her weightlifting. That duality is so patently Emma it ends up bringing a tender smile to your face. You find yourself gently tracing the prominent vein on the back of her hand, a badge of honor of all the effort she’s put in the gym fod God knows how long (you can pretty much assume how hard), as you watch her face relax from the unpleasant feelings as her breath deepens and she eventually falls into a more peaceful slumber. You trade her wet towel for a fresh one, while you check your phone on tips on how to treat her.

You can’t help but both admire and worry about her body. Sure, she has honed every muscle, which stand out even more in her currently dehydrated state, but it is very unusual to not see that perennial aura of power and control gone - in its place, you see this fragilized young woman, who probably never even conceived of asking for support.
  
Eventually, Emma smacks her lips and her eyes flutter, opening slowly before fully realizing your presence.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, it’s alright. You were feverish and I think delirious, but I think the worse is over now. But you need to drink fluids. I brought some orange juice - here!"<</Dialogue>>

Emma is still somewhat shocked by your presence and your offer of help, enough that she can’t even reply, so you push the cup of juice into her hands, and she starts sipping on it tentatively, without ever breaking eye contact - almost as if you could strike like a viper at any second. <<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>Your motherly instincts get the best of you, and you look at her sternly, making it clear you won’t rest until she’s done with the entire receptacle. She tacitly complies.<<else>>You sigh, placing a hand tenderly on her shoulder and nodding, trying to elicit some comfort. You can feel her muscles relaxing under your hand, which makes you smile a bit more.<</if>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Miss <<print $playerLastName>>, what are you doing here?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You didn’t show up at work without any warning, Emma, which is about as normal as a the moon falling from the sky. People got worried, so I took it upon myself to come check on you. I got here and you were burning up with a fever. <<if $carefreeCarefull > 1>>I am not a doctor, but I will guess you weren’t presenting any symptoms of an infection? Because I would hazard a guess this might be stress-related.<<else>>Given everything else, I am pretty sure this might be psychosomatic due to stress...<</if>>"<</Dialogue>>

Emma rolls her eyes, and while it’s somewhat clear she does not want to admit it, she sighs and nods.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I suppose I’ve been fighting some bouts of insomnia and anxiety these last few days that should not have been disregarded. Then my fitness routine was suffering, and I just pushed harder."<</Dialogue>>
 
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You do understand that not everything in life can be fixed through hard work alone, right?"<</Dialogue>>

Emma laughs at that, apparently aware of the humor in the situation.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Listen, I’m mostly concerned with how dehydrated you must be, I’m going to hit the pharmacy and get you something for that."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"No need, I have dozens of bottles of sports drinks in the cabinet under the sink. Just get me a couple."<</Dialogue>>

Following her instructions, you go there and find a couple of crates of a fancy brand of sports drink, and grab three different random flavors.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Pick your poison."<</Dialogue>>

She goes for the passionfruit, while you grab the lime one for yourself.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Bottoms up!"<</Dialogue>>

You mock clinking the plastic bottle against her, and chug it down, and Emma does the same, albeit at a slower pace. She’s very clearly trying to downplay that’s she not feeling great.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know you don’t need to pretend to be strong in front of me, right?"<</Dialogue>>

Emma first looks surprised, then disappointed.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I... it just comes naturally, I suppose. It’s nothing personal, I hope you understand."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, I get it. But it’s friend <<print $playerFirstName>>. I don’t even know where you work, as far as I am concerned. My only concern is your well-being."<</Dialogue>>

And at that precise moment, Emma freezes for a second, like something cracking inside of her. Her eyes fully focused on you, her lips turn downward, and you feel like a side of Emma that’s been buried for a long time has a chance to come to the surface, desperate for air. You hold her hand, and she squeezes your as firmly as she can in her current state.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Thanks, <<print $playerFirstName>>, I’m feeling a lot better already."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $carefreeCarefull < 0 || $submissiveDominant > 1>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I hope you don’t mind, but I emailed HR and said you would take a sick day today and tomorrow."<</Dialogue>>

Emma opens her mouth to protest, but you look sternly at her, and she pouts, which just makes you laugh out loud. Defeated, she shrugs and nods.

<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I’m going to email HR, I think you should just take a sick day today and tomorrow."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"But the office-wide meeting...!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... will still happen, even if a few days late, and the world will not end because of that, believe it or not!"<</Dialogue>>

Emma pouts, but then nods, defeated. It brings a smile to your face - it may have taken a full-blown fever, but you have won an argument against Emma! You should call a news crew!

<</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So how does it feel?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I think the fever is not as bad."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, I mean, knowing the world won’t fall apart if you take a day off."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Ha, ha. Very funny."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m serious, though. You do understand the office will still be there next week, right? I’m not saying you are not important and God knows how much we need you, but everyone will survive if you are not perfect 24/7."<</Dialogue>>

Emma looks down, somewhat bothered.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean you are any less awesome - heck, I still want to be a quarter as awesome as you someday, I just want you to understand you are not Atlas himself, with the globe on his shoulder..."<</Dialogue>>

You squeeze her shoulder again.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Though you certainly LOOK muscular enough to be squatting the planet."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $muscle >= 65>><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Says the woman who might actually do it."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Stop being so modest, Emma, even after being sick for a while, you could probably step directly on stage!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You are too nice."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Am I, though?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I mean, sure, I suppose I could..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So why don’t you?"<</Dialogue>>

<<elseif $muscle >= 50>><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Coming from you? That’s about as high a compliment as any figure competitor could expect."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So why don’t you?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Why don’t I what?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Compete, duh!"<</Dialogue>>

<<elseif $muscle >= 40>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You aren’t so shabby yourself, you know? I bet you could place on the upcoming competition."<</Dialogue>>

<<if COMPETING is true>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, guess what! I registered for it, and I could use some REAL competition."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I’m sure you’ll get some, but given your current gains, you should do fine."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, but I don’t want just anyone, I want THE BEST to compete against!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And who would that be?"<</Dialogue>>

You just look annoyed at Emma, raising your eyebrow as you put your hands on your hips.

<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I suppose I could, but what fun would that be without some company and some REAL competition? You know, from someone I really admire."<</Dialogue>>

You look expectantly at her.

<</if>>
<<else>>
Emma laughs, but you just keep looking at her dead seriously. She is taken aback by that, and you just grab her arm.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look at these muscles! I know how much effort it took to get there - and I also know how much you cherish that hard work. Don’t you  think it’s time to show the world?"<</Dialogue>>

<</if>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Oh, I couldn’t. Competitions are not only a lot of work that I can’t afford to put in with my career, but it would also affect how people perceive me if they knew, it’s already hard enough being a woman in a position of leadership - it would create several issues that I can’t even begin ennumerating."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Did I mention the world will not fall apart if you are not perfect for 5 seconds? Though, I would argue, sharing your physique with the world is just bound to raise more questions whether you ARE perfect, or possibly a robot. I still haven’t ruled that one out myself."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>>You playfully pinch her firm thighs. The taut muscle is not fully flexed and thus still somewhat pliant, but feels powerful.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, jury’s still out on the robot thing, I think I might have to get a knife and see if that’s muscle or servomotors under your skin."<</Dialogue>>

<<else>>
You look at her developed legs, and bite your lips.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I joke about the robot thing, but there are days I would not be surprised if I saw you performing some incredible feats of strength."<</Dialogue>>

<</if>>
Emma does blush slightly from your compliment, but slouches as she sighs.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I am humbled by your confidence in me, but I don’t know how justified it is."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Listen, this isn’t about insecurity regarding the competition itself, right? Your concern is what people think of you, wouldn’t you agree?"<</Dialogue>>

Emma does not answer, but her face says it all.

<<if $shyConfident > 1>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I think it’s no stretch to say we have established that the world will not crumble without you to watch over it. And as it turns out, that also applies to your work - sure, I think you should keep it professional AT THE OFFICE. But once you clock out, who cares if you are a dominatrix at a nightclub or taming lions at a circus - as long as it’s not illegal, that’s YOUR problem, and not anyone else’s. "<</Dialogue>>

<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I think I understand. I used to worry a lot about what people thought of me. Actually, strike that. I think I was disappointed with myself because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to be, and I felt judged. But ever since I started my life here on campus, I changed. And sure, people reacted to that, but what I learned is that it’s what I think that matters in the end."<</Dialogue>>

<</if>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>..."<</Dialogue>>

She looks deep within your eyes, and you can see her resolve steeling.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You are right. It’s time I stop compromising my passion just because people might think less of me. I’ve worked hard to get where I am, and I am not about to sacrifice anything else just because of what people may think!"<</Dialogue>>

You smile and hug Emma.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That’s what I wanted to hear!"<</Dialogue>>

Emma hugs you back quite firmly. You can feel her fingers digging into your skin, and her breathing feel warm against your neck.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, I have no words to thank you for breaking through the professional veneer and making me feel seen. Truly."<</Dialogue>>

Her breathing goes deeper, and it makes you feel a shiver - this is more intimate than you’ve ever been with Emma.

Your hand slides down her back towards her glutes, and this seems to encourage Emma to nuzzle your neck lightly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Emma, I... I know office romance is frowned upon but..."<</Dialogue>>

Emma stands back and puts her finger on your lips, shushing you. 
<<if $muscle >60>>She just nods towards the stairs that leads to her mezzanine bed, and you acknowledge it by scooping her in your muscular arms, easily lifting your boss in a princess carry. Her eyes widen at your display of power, and she bites her lips. You carefully climb the steps as she wraps her own muscular arms against your gigantic neck and shoulders, and you carefully place her on her bed. You kneel next to it, giving Emma a passionate kiss, and she goes in with all tongue she can, like a monster that was waiting for be unleashed for years. Her hands probe your torso, until you feel the need to put a brake on.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You are still recovering. Let’s put a pin on this - but just for now."<</Dialogue>>
  
<<elseif $muscle >45>>Emma makes an effort to stand up, but it’s clear she’s still a bit woozy. So you slide an arm to hold her torso, and you help her walk up the stairs to her mezzanine bed. She sits down, and wraps her arms around you once again, using her weight to pull you down. But you can feel the effort, so you give her a passionate kiss, then push her gently to a laying position.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You are still recovering. Let’s put a pin on this - but just for now."<</Dialogue>>
 
<<else>>
Emma makes an effort to stand up, but it’s clear she’s still a bit woozy. You try your best to offer her a shoulder for support as she makes her way up the mezzanine stairs to her bed, which she looks at with hungry eyes. You give her a passionate kiss, before helping her sit down.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You are still recovering. Let’s put a pin on this - but just for now."<</Dialogue>>

<</if>>
You cover her with her super nice satin sheets (damn, what’s the thread count on this?), and she seems almost miserable for a second, but once she sees your smile, she seems comforted.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It may be one of the things you are not an expert at, but you need to rest. We’ll find some time for ourselves later. That, I can guarantee."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do you need anything else before I go? You can always call me if you need anything."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, you know the one thing I want right now..."<</Dialogue>>

You look at her, amused.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I suppose I could watch some corny soap operas. I really haven’t found the time, they are a bit of guilty pleasure, I’m afraid, and I suppose now is the best time to just relax with some soup."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That’s better. So, you know, one phone call away. Understood?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I can barely wait."<</Dialogue>>

And with that, you take your leave, and return home, fighting more urges than you’d like to admit. Now you just need to hope she takes this downtime seriously... so you can have the OTHER time of horizontal fun at a later date.’

<<link "I am glad to be of help - but, just making sure, I’m here as a friend.">><<replace "#emmaRelationshipChoice">>
As Emma hugs you harder, you start softening your touch.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m glad to have you as a friend, even if it might make things awkward at work, Emma. So, I hope you can count on me in the future."<</Dialogue>>

Emma freezes, and then lets go. She got the message right away, thankfully, without making things weirder.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And I am not sure I will ever be able to thank you properly for this. I’m also glad you are so proactive about keeping our professional relationship separate from this. However, I suppose I’ll have to find it within me to compartimentalize a bit more to fully appreciate your friendship... AFTER clocking out, obviously."<</Dialogue>>

She gives you a mischievous wink, and it’s incredibly refreshing to see her loosening a bit.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do you need anything else before I go? Are you going to be okay? You can always call me if you need anything."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Nah, I already feel like a million bucks. Hell, I feel like I could go and run a mara..."<</Dialogue>>

You look angrily at her.

Suddenly, the elevator dings, everyone ducks under their respective desks<<if $muscle >65 || $height >205>>, including yourself - and given your comically oversized body, it’s a bit humorous, making some of your coworkers giggle at your attempt at stealth<</if>>. The door slowly opens, and Emma comes out, very confused by the empty office and no lights on. She steps out, when...<br><br>
<b>“SURPRISE!!!”</b><br><br>
Emma jumps back, almost dropping her briefcase, as everyone pops out from their desks with poppers and party blowers. The boss is left wide-eyed and frozen, as you approach her.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Emma. I talked to the team, everyone was worried when you were absent, and they wanted to do something special for you, so..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Employee">>"I hope you like coconut! This cake that Sue makes is really good!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He hands Emma a slice of cake on a paper plate, and she still seems to be reeling from the whiplash of the surprise.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, I can absolutely confirm it was a surprise, that is undeniable."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I originally wanted to do this right after you came back from your, erm, break, but it took some planning and I wanted to make sure to pull it off at a time it wouldn’t hurt productivity."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"How well you know me, miss <<print $playerLastName>>."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"We always aim to please. But right now, you should go mingle, I think everyone would like to let you know how much they like having you managing the office."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And so you <<if $muscle >55>>gently <<elseif $muscle < 35>>forcefully <</if>>push Emma towards the big hubbub, watching as she tries to navigate awkwardly as the overly-enthusiastic and extremely friendly crew hugs and praises her. It’s somewhat endearing to see how hard it is for her to accept that people look up to her and cherish her. For once, you can just sit back and relax as you watch the others do the work to help your boss.<br><br>
You smile as Emma slowly allows her surprise and unease to melt, you can see her shoulders untensing, her smile widening and becoming more relaxed, her usual coldness and distance unraveling as she becomes just another employee instead of the stern boss - that is not to say, she’s still completely professional, but it’s like she doesn’t need to act like some constantly alert sentry.<br><br>
You enjoy some cake and coffee yourself, keeping your distance as you watch Emma from afar, blossoming like a flower before your very eyes. It’s still very much her, but... more zen? You are not even sure how to put it in words - all you know is that you like what you see.<br><br>
Eventually the celebration starts winding down, and Emma settles in the cafeteria exchanging some funny stories with other senior members of the staff that have been there since she joined the branch. But as they disperse, you come in, and pull a chair next to her.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Who could’ve guessed, seems like you have some fans here in the office."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma smirks, taking a sip of the cheap coffee.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I knew you were sneaky, but this was surprisingly crafty, miss <<print $playerLastName>>."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You take a purposefully long sip of the brown swill they somehow get away with classifying as a coffee brew, hiding your smile as you prepare your retort.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, you know, they say you really ought to suck up to your boss to get ahead. I’m just really looking out for myself professionally."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma chuckles, but there’s that melancholy edge as she slumps a bit on her cheap plastic chair. Now it’s only the two of you in the cafeteria as everyone has returned to their work. She sighs, before continuing.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You joke, but I have to admit I feel strangely self-conscious now about the way I deal with my professional persona."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Putting the cup down, you look at her rife with curiosity, your eyes showing how anxious you are for Emma to elaborate.<br><br>

It’s clear that Emma feels some kindred with what you just said. She takes another long sip, looking away in deep thought, before continuing.<br><br>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I wish you could’ve seen me in my first day at work.

And one day it all kind of came tumbling down - while I did have some responsibility, I wasn’t properly trained, and it was easy for him to blame ‘the new girl’. It was then that I learned that sometimes you just have to be on constant lookout and know that everyone is smelling the blood in the water. This was just the first of many incidents - including being passed for promotion just for being a woman. And I don’t think most people even realized they were being sexist, everyone seemed to just be perpetuating their old habits. So I rolled my sleeves and decided that I was not going let ANYTHING stand in my way. I was going to be the hardest working person in the office, and broadcast how serious and strict I was, because it was the only way I would be seen as an equal. And I suppose it worked, as my meteoric rise would prove. And yet, I feel like I sacrificed something in the process. The mask came with a cost."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You are speechless. I mean, it’s not like you did not know this side of Emma, but to see her opening her heart and explaining how she grew into this person...<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I mean, don’t get this wrong. It is still very much who I am, the person I grew into. There’s no doubt that I was finding myself in this process - it’s part of the reason I got so profoundly involved in fitness - not only because I ABSOLUTELY needed a way to vent all my frustrations, but I felt like I had to prove myself to be taken seriously. But today you made me look back, and it’s slightly unnerving to think that I had conquered this respect for this persona, but perhaps I could have found a balance - not to compromise my values, but somehow not expect my self worth to come exclusively from my excellence, as unsustainable as it might be."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You place your hand over Emma’s.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m pretty sure the entire office realizes just how much you bring to the table, Emma. But you are right that you don’t need to be perfect for people to find you valuable. Heck, you took your chance with me, and I don’t know that I’ll ever live up to your standards!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You laugh, but Emma goes extra serious when you say that.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Maybe we both have something to teach each other here. I may be your senior, but in this short time, I feel like you have helped me grow more than you realize."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You motion to hug Emma, but she stiffens and pushes her chair backwards, sending a clear message. Yeah, she still has an image to maintain at the office.<br><br>

            You insist, and push yourself against her for a hug, and she just turns her head as you squeeze her taut torso. Immediately, she makes it clear you stepped over a line, but still you push, like trying to crack an eggshell. You can feel her muscles contracting as she tries to actively break away.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Look, I understand you mean well, <<print $playerFirstName>>, but this is not only a process for me, but just because I said I’m figuring myself out, it doesn’t mean that the other aspect is not still an important part of who I am. And my devotion and commitment to this job is a major element of that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You wince, aware of your mistake, and try to brush it off, but it’s just as awkward.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, duh, of course I know! It was like a joke, really. But it’s okay."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Emma still looks at you dearly, however. You can almost feel a telepathic link telling you she just wants to run her fingers through your hair as she says it.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"But it’s alright. I guess we both have things we need to figure out, and for once I’m glad I won’t have to do it alone. So we’ll tackle it together, and at times we’ll probably slip and mess up like this. The beauty is that, for once, I’m allowing myself not to be infallible all the time."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See? Even when I mess up, I still score!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Emma chuckles, rolling her eyes.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Incorrigible, is what you are."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You shrug, getting up, as Emma looks around to make sure no one is around, before pinching your <<if $muscle>80>>titanic <<elseif $muscle>55>>diamond-hard, perfectly shaped <<elseif $muscle > 40>>impressive bubble <</if>>ass. She mouths a silent ‘thank you’ as she stands up and straightens her impeccable suit.<br><br>
            You return to your station, hoping to soon get an opportunity to spend some quality time with Emma away from the office.

            You start leaning against Emma for a hug, but you hesitate as she turns her face, and before you know the two of you are doing a weird awkward dance trying to sort of get out of each other’s way.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Look, I am looking forward to some warmer confraternizing, but not during business hours, I am sure you understand."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"O-of course!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You say, sort of avoiding eye contact and stepping aside with embarrassment as Emma recomposes herself.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Still, good job on the party. It does mean a lot to me. And, hey, maybe it’s a sign that you are management material!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, keep studying, but who knows what tomorrow brings? I’m confident enough to say I think both of us want to find out."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She gives you a wink, and returns to her office. How can Emma have such a commanding presence? You keep asking yourself that as you return to your station, having a hard time concentrating on your tasks for the rest of the day.

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"For now we’ll put a pin on it. Because I think you also need something a bit more personal, if you catch my drift."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Your eyes scan Emma’s delectable clavicle, revealing just a hint of her defined pecs, what little of her upper body you can glimpse from that shirt (which you would pay top dollar to just rip off of her right now). You lick your lips, and Emma gets the message loud and clear, responding with that trademark smug smile and a raise of a single eyebrow.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I’m sure to find a window in my schedule for a one-on-one performance review, miss <<print $playerLastName>>."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            Emma’s smile opens, revealing her pristine whites, and she stands up, offering her hand for a shake. You both grab each others palms very firmly, and just that is enough to start making you wet.<br><br>

            You try to approach her with a confident smile as you lay your hand on the table by her side, but end up hesitating and lose your balance, tripping and falling face-first on her bosom. Emma’s hands shoot up with impressive reflexes, trying to stabilize you, <<if $muscle >65 || $height >185 || $fat >55>>but your considerable size make that a fool’s errand, and you end up just pushing her chair back before tipping to the side and falling to the ground, which makes the entire cafeteria shake. Other employees come running to check on you, but you insist that everything is okay. Emma offers a hand to help you up, which you embarassedly accept.<<else>>her strong arms grabbing you firmly.

    content: `You see Emma doing her usual rounds, her clipboard with a thicker stack of paper than usual, and her pace slower as she travels from employee to employee.<br><br>
You watch as she hands a leaf to each employee, along with a little talk, and proceeds to the next, the ritual seemingly repeating over and over. When she is between people, you decide to approach her.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hello, there, boss. Are you campaigning to run for office?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You immediately realize how lame that joke was, but try to keep a straight face, hoping it will be less embarassing if you don’t acknowledge it.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Very funny. I don’t know that I would be on my popularity around here, but I am not certainly I was built for public office anyway, the private sector certainly suits me better. Why, I am sure you’d like me better in private, correct?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Dang, she just flipped that on you like it was nothing, a discreet wink that was so hidden in her professional face you might think she was having a stroke. Note to self, don’t spar verbally with Emma, you’re hopelessly outmatched.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But seriously, what’s with this paper distribution?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Union rules, I need to pass along a physical printout and tell each employee individually about changes to the benefits package - it’s a formality I wish I could include in an emails, but them’s the rules. Here’s yours, you’ll see that it’s discussing the changes that are coming with the cost cutting."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I bet you are even more bothered by the fact that it’s cutting into your productive time, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You read me like a book, miss <<print $playerLastName>>. I had to cancel two appointments, it will probably take me all day to do this. I am not pleased, but I am not about to break the rules."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She’s trying to play it cool, but you can sense how flustered she is under her professional demeanor. You’ve got to know her enough that she’ll need to vent a bit - or we might just be on the way for another meltdown.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, how about we go out for some drinks after work?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma is about to say something, which very much looks like it would be a no, but she stops herself. In a very uncharacteristic twist, she looks up and to the side in thought, mulling her answer. It’s brief, but Emma always feels like she has a script ready at all times, and it’s almost funny to see that reaction. She eventually looks back at you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You know what, my productivity is shot no matter what, if I try to sneak a partial task it’s not going to be dealt with properly anyway, might as well chalk that as PTO and invest it so I am more productive later."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Great! I’ll come pick you up at lobby when your shift ends. Have fun distributing those leaflets."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Only because I’ll be thinking of you while I do."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And so you go back to your tasks, taking a quick break to look at your phone to figure out a cool place to take her after your shift.

    content: `Time seems to slow to a crawl when you are anxious, but you shift is finally over and you find yourself practically RUNNING to the lobby to meet Emma. She’s a couple minutes late, but you can tell she touched up her makeup, and while it seems like a silly small thing, it makes you feel important somehow.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, here I am. Will you enlighten me in the way of the proletarian entertainment?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No offense, but do you purposefully go out of your way to say these things to make me feel a bit dumb?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Apologies, it’s just my baseline, and I should be more considerate about how I make people feel."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She looks genuinely apologetic, so you start waving your palms as you hurriedly reply:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, no, that was a joke. Well, I do feel a bit dumb, but it’s just because I’m constantly in awe at how amazing you are with words."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Still, you have a point, I don’t usually take into consideration other people’s feelings as much as I focus on clarity. Perhaps it’s another thing I should look into."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You tug Emma by her meaty arm, hugging it as you pull her to the street and towards the nearby pub.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, no, we are not worrying about stuff right now, we are going to have ourselves a merry old time! Proletarian-style!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She laughs, slipping her hand around your waist. It gives you a warm feeling all over. You wrap your own arm around her shoulder, and together you make your way to the place.<br><br>
The pub is a weird mix - it feels very old-style with its wooden walls, dark ambiance and retro colorful stained glass sconces, but it also employs a digital menu with QR codes and mobile ordering. It actually works perfectly for you, however, as it means you get a lot of privacy as you score a nice booth by the back corner. It means the two of you can forget the rest of the world as you hold hands with Emma, getting lost in her confident eyes as she keeps commenting about the place and her own dislike of digital menus.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I fully understand the efficiencies of these systems, but they clearly aren’t mature enough to be an adequate replacement of proper service. But I suppose there has to be a period of growing pains to get to a mature product."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You squeeze Emma’s hand hard. It’s such an interesting feeling, her calloused hands are very firm and strong, yet impeccably moisturized. Her short nails are functional but still trimmed and polished to perfection, feeling smooth and creating an interesting contrast with the textures the veins give to top of her hand. But it’s the way she uses that really gets to you - while you give it some random squeezes, Emma’s fingertips will occasionally travel over your palm and wrist, and it’s like she has a fucking map of yours nerves as she somehow sends chills and shocks through you like it was nothing! It’s a bit of an effort to even carry a conversatio, but you manage.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So let me give you the first lesson in how the workforce enjoys their leisure time: we don’t really talk about businesses when we are having drinks."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Fair enough. So, what do we talk about?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I suppose badmouthing our bosses behind their back won’t work here. Damn! But, we could learn more about each other!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You bite your lips, and Emma starts running her bare feet over your calves. Her movements are both probing and seductive, like she’s winding you like a powerful coil, ready to blow megatons of energy with as little as a sneeze - and she does it all with the most stone-cold poker face you’ve ever seen, which only makes your blood boil even more. It takes all your willpower not to jump her right there and then!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Anyone ever tell you how you really know your way around a woman’s body?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Several times, actually, though it really just comes naturally to me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I should have known, everything feels so effortless for you..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma blushes, and it’s adorable. You can’t help but laugh, and she goes for a sip of her cherry martini, stalling. <<if $shyConfident > 1>>So you move to the offensive.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What I really want is to know more about you. How did you get into fitness?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<else>>You want to break the ice, so you decide to probe a bit.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"There’s so much I want to know about you. I could ask more about your taste in girls, but maybe we should start a little easier. Like, how did you get into fitness, for instance?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
Emma puts down the drink, and looks nostalgic as she stares into the distance. She sighs, and says:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"It’s actually something from a long time ago, and it’s funny you asked that, because it’s also how I figured I was into girls. Wow, it feels like an eternity ago..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her phone buzzes with an email alert, and she reaches for it. Like lightning, you grab and put it in your pocket, looking at her with the most serious face.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nuh-huh, you can’t start with a line like that and not spill the tea!!! I’m confiscating this device until I hear this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma looks at you with that smile, oh, that smug smile, as she puts her elbows on the table, and rests her chin on her hands. You can’t help but appreciate the way she fills those tight sleeves, but frankly, it’s hard enough to pick where to look - her eyes command attention in a way that’s hard to put in words, and you get a chill down your spine as she starts telling her story.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I suppose I could bore you for a bit with my younger years, but don’t come complaining later - I’m afraid it’s rather mundane, really."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ll be the judge of that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>  
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Fine. Well, you see, my teenage years weren’t particularly interesting. Blue collar father, stay at home mother, small town. During the summer I was sent to a camp - and I was just another generic face in a sea of other teens - a gangly girl with no aspirations, just coasting along. And I suppose this would be entirely a non-story if not for that one camp counselor."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her eyes again look into the distance, memories flooding in. Emma’s smile is no longer the smug one, but a very warm and melancholy one, and you wait with bated breath for her to continue.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Go on...!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You see, I was at that awkward phase, I suppose I was just the blank template of the person I was going to become. But it all changed when I woke up one morning before everyone else. I was still in the sweats I wore to sleep, grogily going out of the cabin. The sun had just started rising, and everything was still quiet. But as I made my way to the outhouse, I froze. There she was, gleaming against the sun, like a Greek goddess, doing chin ups on a tree branch. Her name was Joanna, and she was one of the conselours. I was literally mesmerized, I could not take my eyes off of her, wearing a sports bra and shorts, her toned midriff glistening with sweat running through it like a gutter. She would give these short, soft grunts every time she raised herself, her upper arms contracting with the belly of the biceps being one of the most beautiful curves I’d ever seen in a woman."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You just suck your moscow mule through the crazy straw, eyes completely glued to Emma as she continues.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I guess I didn’t know at the time, she was the most incredible thing I’d ever seen. I don’t know if I realized at the time what my hormones were telling me, but I idolized Joanna. I wanted to be just like her - this picture of perfection, pure physical poetry. Yeah, I was incredibly turned on, but I guess it would take a while for me to be able to process THAT part. But I wasn’t ready to talk to her - no, it was downright intimidating, and I ended up returning to the cabin with a full bladder, but her physique was seared into my mind."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Your straw starts making a loud noise as you finish the entire cup in a single suck of the straw, the vodka going straight to your brain and making you woozy. You still keep sucking, unable to process any information until you actually run out of breath. Emma looks at you, concerned, and with a cough and a shake of your head, you keep your wide-open eyes trained on her.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So did you go talk to her or what?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Oh, I mean, there was a whole puppy love thing, sure, and I stalked her during that stay - oh, you bet I enrolled for every physical activity she was involved in, and even today I am not sure where my desire to be her ended and this crush started, but I can tell you, the second I got home from camp, I joined the gymnastics team and begged my parents for some equipment. Before I knew it, it sparked a passion in me, not only for the physical goals, but excellency in everything I committed myself to. Well, that, and my admiration for the female form, I suppose."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma completes, with a wink, as she runs the back of her hand through the side of your neck:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And I must say, it does not get much finer than you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
It’s your turn to blush. <<if $muscle >80>>It doesn’t keep Emma from exploring your superhuman physique, carefully tracing each pencil-sized vein like a prospector looking for gold. 
<<elseif $muscle >60>>It doesn’t keep Emma from exploring your top-level bodybuilder physique, probing the fibrous corners of each overdeveloped muscle, appreciating each striation like a wonder of nature. 
<<elseif $muscle >45>>It doesn’t keep Emma from delighting herself in the soft-skinned but firm curves of your fitness competitor-level muscles, her fingers making wave-like motions with the ebb and flow of your physique. 
<<elseif $muscle >30>>It doesn’t keep Emma from exploring your recent gains, showing deep appreciation for the effort you put recently as new curves emerge in your developing physique. 
<<else>>It doesn’t keep Emma from fully appreciating your feminine curves, absent-mindedly running her fingers through every socially-acceptable part of your skin she has access to. 
<</if>>She does it all with such delight that you can’t help but sort of melt under her, closing your eyes so you can appreciate every moment to the fullest. You both sigh at the same time, which then elicits chuckles from both.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess we are sorta back to the puppy love phase, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"No. I mean, you look amazing, but there’s so much more to you, <<print $playerFirstName>>. In some ways, I feel like you helped me unravel myself in a much more important way."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She holds your hand and mumbles a thank you, before reaching over for a deep and passionate kiss. It feels like a rocket igniting inside of you, her soft tongue probing gently as her hand squeezes yours, and you gently sway your hips as your back contracts and relaxes to the magical feelings she brings.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And I’m not going to lie, I sort of wish I wasn’t cutting for the bodybuilding competition right now, otherwise I might just get a heavier drink and then <<if $muscle >45>>have you carry me back home<<else>>carry you back home<</if>> and fuck you silly."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, yeah, we still have that. Kinda regretting getting into that with you now."<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, I’ll tell you what - why don’t we schedule some gym time together next week? I could use a little cheering, and you get to appreciate the goods in a forum where it’s more appropriate for me to don sportswear."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hmmmm, I like the way you think."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"So, what do you say? Are you game? Or is a gym date too corny?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sweaty, pumped up Emma in swimwear? I could do worse, I suppose."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma gives you a mock punch, and you two laugh. You begrudgingly return her phone so she can check her schedule, and agree to a little rendezvous at the gym next week after work.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I have to say, these casual outings are not bad. Had I known, maybe I wouldn't have been so resistant."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, if it's an incentive you need, I can think of a few..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say, as you pull her close and give her another passionate kiss, squeezing her cheeks as you both get breathless. All is good.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hmmmm, while I would love to stay longer, I do still have to answer some emails. But I am glad you dragged me here. Maybe I'll make a habit of scheduling more confraternization with my employees."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess I now have my incentive to get that Employee of the Month prize."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You are still getting no preferential treatment, just to be clear."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Damn. Had to try, though, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma leaves a bill on the table and makes her way out. She turns around near the door, and waves at you, biting her lips, before disappearing. You sigh, contemplating drowning your sorrows in another drink. But knowing you'll be sharing that gym with Emma soon, you decide to keep your caloric intake down, as you want to look your best for her come next week!`

    content: `You packed your gym bag to the office, eager to spend some time in the gym with Emma. She seems to be less bashful about her physique lately - in fact, you even caught her one time gleefully helping someone switch the bottle on the water cooler. It’s small things, but they always seem to bring a smile to your face.<br><br>
So when your shift is done, and Emma should also be done, you send her a text message asking if she’d like to walk to the gym together. She answers that she will need a minute, so you can go ahead. You hesitate, but figure it’s not worth arguing - and thus make your way there.<br><br>
Once at the gym, you go to the changing room, where you put your own workout outfit. <<if $muscle >80>>It’s still somewhat surreal to see that you’ve basically grown into some sort of superhuman demonstration of hypertrophy potential - and a challenge to most of the equipment available in the gym. You stand out so much that you even wonder if there isn’t even an ethical issue in participating in the bodybuilding contest to begin with.<<elseif $muscle >60>>You looked at your enormous muscles, which just scream “Yeah, I am a bodybuilder”, veins punctuating the bloated flesh like parts of a physiological poem that confirm your right to compete in the event.<<elseif $muscle >45>>You revel on your physical accomplishments, which put you a step ahead in the upcoming bodybuilding competition as this paragon of female fitness, and make you feel worthy (in more ways than one).<<elseif $muscle >30>>You are glad to have built your body over the last few weeks, but you can’t help but feel like you still have a long road ahead of you, and Emma’s example only puts further pressure on you.<<else>>Your fitness journey is still only beginning, but you can’t help but wonder if maybe it was a bad idea to register for the bodybuilding competition, as you watch your rather muscle-deficient physique on the mirror.<</if>> <<if $fat > 40>>You also realize that you’ll probably have to start worrying about losing some fat, and the word “cutting” somehow feels more harmful than actual act of breaking the skin and bleeding. Still, it’s something you’ll have to worry as the competition approaches. <<elseif $fat >30>>Thankfully, you won’t need major worries about losing too much fat, as you already feel somewhat lean and on your way to be ready for the final stretch before the big day. <<elseif $fat >20>>The last bit of fluff you need to lose shouldn’t be much of a hurdle at this point, mostly the usual prep as the competition approaches, probably something you can do mostly with your diet. <<else>>You already feel super dry, with each muscle properly on display given your rather lean body - which you confirm with a nice pinch of very pliable skin. One less worry.<</if>><br><br>
But what really dominates your mind is Emma. You briefly wonder if your physique is something that will affect her own performance AND her feelings for you as the stress of the fastly-approaching deadline comes. Bodybuilding is some serious business, but right now your focus is giving Emma all the support you can - this is HER moment to shine, and you want nothing but to be there for her.<br><br>
And as if on command, you hear the characteristic sound of her fancy shoes clacking against the tile. You turn, but it’s her reaction that catches you: her eyes scan you from top to bottom, and that brings a smile to her face, which gives you butterflies in your stomach.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Sorry, I was held up for a bit, but now I am here distraction-free, as a good workout should be. Though, I have to say, you are not about to make that easy."<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
That makes you giggle, as you help her with her rather small and discreet gym bag. You find yourself lacking the wit to say something as clever, so you console yourself with just helping her fold her office outfit neatly as she puts it away in her locker, wearing her usual gym attire.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Have I ever said you look really good in sportswear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, right now what matters is that I don’t look good enough, but we will address that posthaste."<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, that’s the spirit! I feel like I should have brought some pompoms to motivate you, though!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Oh, worry not, you have plenty of other assets that will do a much more effective job at that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She says, as she sneaks a pinch to the bottom of your ass. The two of you exchange a knowing smile.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Here, hand me your bottle, I’ll get you some cold water and meet you by the treadmill, I assume you’ll want to warm up with a short run?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma briefly pauses, like she was going to correct you, but then she shakes her head and tosses you the bottle.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"See you there in a sec!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You rush to get both your bottles filled up at the fountain, before setting yourself by the treadmill. But as Emma comes out of the changing room, time slows down - even though you’ve seen her change, you can’t help but appreciate as she walks confidently through the gym. Each step is strong and deliberate, and her eyes are straight and focused, like the world could be falling apart (or she could be getting quite a few looks from other gymgoers, which is probably a thing) and she would not even dignify that with a response. Instead, her shoulders move slightly but powerfully, giving her the sway of an apex predator feline. Her bulbous deltoids and pronounced trapezius only reinforce that, as do her wide-set hips and rounded glutes that contrast with her rather tight waist. As each leg efficiently gives another step with her respectable and pronounced quadriceps, you need to shake yourself off of wanting to be the very floor upon which she walks.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Thanks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She says, while grabbing the cold water bottle from your hand and breaking your trance. She quickly taps the panel on the treadmill and is immediately on a quick incline jog, which you trip over yourself to imitate on the unit besides her.<br><br>
<<if $muscle>65>>It is mostly trivial to keep up with her pace as you find yourself at peak physical condition, and despite the groaning of the equipment due to your weight, you could probably do this all day. <<elseif $muscle >40>>You manage to keep up with Emma’s cardio routine, finding yourself equally challenged, which you assume is a good thing. <<elseif $muscle >30>>Emma’s pace is not only grueling, but downright brutal as you try to keep up. Breathless, you force yourself to do your best, erratically trying to keep your feet properly balanced, but it’s an enormous challenge. You decide to slow your own treadmill a bit, allowing you to properly continue your exercise.<<else>>It quickly proves to be an insurmountable task, as you confirm you can barely even balance yourself at those setting, so you just set the device to a brisk pace and accept that you can’t quite match your workout buddy.<</if>> And so you find yourself distracted with Emma - watching as she bounces in her meticulously consistent run: the perfect form as she waves her toned arms back and forth, the way her solid legs efficiently move in what appears to be a clockwork motion, the slight bounce of her tight pecs, and those eyes. Oh, those determined eyes. The thin sheet of sweat making her glisten only accentuates her beauty. If it wasn’t the fact you were burning some seriously calories, you could probably just keep watching her forever.<br><br>
Eventually Emma slows her own treadmill down, and you quickly get off yours, handing her a towel and trying to motivate her:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, that was pretty impressive! You’ll be ready for the competition in no time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Oh, that? That was just my warmup - the actual cardio I do running outdoors."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"WHAAAAAAAAAAT?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Ok, you are exaggerating a bit, which amuses Emma.<br><br><</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, what’s next on the docket?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma dries the sweat off her forehead with the towel as she starts laying down her plan:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, the competition is all about symmetry, and I have a pretty solid upper body base, but my core needs some work - and I still think I can put a little effort on my back."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
What seems like Emma just setting up a strategy, you realize, is her actually trying to impart her knowledge to you. She obviously knew exactly what she wanted to do before she even arrived, but she’s trying to break it down - and, you assume, include you so you aren’t just left as the inconsequential audience. It’s not the warmest show of affection you’ve ever seen, but she’s clearly trying.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, what?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I’m going to do some sets on the lat pulldown and my ab circuit on the bar."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $skills[0].level > 2>>You nod, and put the wide bar on the pulldown machine, asking Emma how much weight should you set it to. Emma smiles, looking at you with a hint of concern:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"It’s adorable that you want to be so helpful, but you don’t need to do all that. I’m quite capable, and I’ll settle for your support... and maybe the occasional spot."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You take a step back, and let her do her thing. 
<<else>>You look around, trying to figure out how to help, but before you even process it, Emma is already setting up the machine, and grabbing the handles, starting her first rep. 
<</if>>
And so she starts her first set, her back rippling and expanding as she methodically cranks her reps... and then she increases the weights and continues with her pyramid set. By the time she hits her third set, the reps slow down and become much more labored, until she seemingly stall on her fourth one, and you feel the urge to step in.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"If anyone can do it, it’s you, Emma!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma grimaces, but you can see a hint of a smile as she hears your cheer, and with a soft grunt, she finishes the rep, and cranks that fifth one - slowly but suredly. Then she lets go of the load, and increases the weight one last time. It’s her max, and it’s going to be tough, you can already tell. You just place your hand on her back, and whisper in her ear:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You got this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma smirks, and wraps her fingers around the bar tightly, her forearms tensing as she takes a deep breath, and you find yourself mimicking her in anticipation. She pulls the bar, and you can almost feel the enormous weight yourself<<if $muscle >55>> (even though you could probably do that with ease, but that’s beside the point)<</if>>. The bar acquiesces to her iron will, as you witness her pulling it down as if she was taming a wild horse. And she comes through, trembling, as the bar completes its circuit, being returned to its original position with full control. Emma sprouts her sinewy wings as she does so, as she finishes, she lets out a huge breath, and you erupt in applause.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Woooooo! You did it!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"And... huff... now, for the descent..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Emma lowers the load to the previous one, to do another 5 reps as she tackles the backside of the pyramid set. You watch as she rests, her face reddened from the effort, trying to stretch her muscles as she psyches herself. You come in to spot her, just hovering your hands over the bar, but even as she struggles, you motion to hold the bar, but Emma just stares coldly at you - and you get the message. You watch her herculean effort as she proceeds to do her reps, lowering the weights and increasing the reps, until she is done.<br><br>
You hand Emma her bottle once more, and she looks very pleased with herself. She takes a long sip and sighs, clearly drained from the effort.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Alright, we’re losing daylight."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You COULD take a break, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I can’t rest when I have that medal on my neck."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Not much arguing against that. Emma gets up and walks up to the bar. <<if $muscle >60>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Can you help a girl get up?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
 You put your hands on her waist and, like a pair of ballet dancers, gently lift her so she can grab the bar. You catch Emma blushing at how easy you make it seem, which only makes you feel more awesome.<<elseif $muscle >45>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Can you help a girl get up?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
 You put your hands on her waist and, with a grunt and some effort, lift her enough to grab the bar. Emma appreciates the spot, nodding as you take a step back.
<<elseif >>$muscle >30>><br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Can you help a girl get up?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
 You intertwine your fingers and bend down so Emma can use your hands as a step to grab the bar. Two things surprise you: Emma is CONSIDERABLY heavier than you expected, but also very graceful in her motions to get to the bar - not a side of her you are used to seeing, as opposed to that very practical and efficient one.
<<else>>Emma grabs a stool and uses it to reach the hanging bar. She does it with unusual grace - not a side of her you are used to seeing, as opposed to that very practical and efficient one.
<</if>><br><br>
Again, Emma’s face goes into that state of full concentration as she starts raising her legs. She starts a whole routine to target her abs, raising, bending, twisting her legs, and it’s like a dance, Her entire body is perfectly still as her hips sway along, and the whole routing is repeated over and over as you see the bricks of her abs tensing in all kinds of ways - solid blocks of muscle, just waiting to spring out of her midsection with each movement of her aerial ballet. You feel like you should probably be saying some inspiring shit about now, but all you can do is watch, mesmerized by the simple yet effective routine. With a finger in your mouth, you almost let your other hand reach and feel those abs, but you hold yourself. Hopefully, Emma is so concentrated she won’t notice.<br><br>
After a few minutes of those exercises, Emma drops down, stretching herself backwards, putting those abs in full, glorious display. You see the sweat running between the still noticeable grooves.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You enjoyed that, didn’t you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And there’s that smug smile again. And you can’t exactly deny it.<br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Enjoy? No, right now I’m just appraising the goods I’ll be delighting myself with later."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, aren’t you confident that you’ll get lucky?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $muscle >45>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Are you telling me you’ll resist THESE goods?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And you reinforce that by flexing your even bigger arm right under her nose.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Showoff."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Like YOU didn’t enjoy that either..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So you’re just gonna rub your physique on my face?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I mean, if you are into that, it COULD be arranged. I’d rather you just lick these muscles, personally."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
<<else>>
<<if $muscle >45>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"A girl can hope, right? I kinda hoped my own progress would somewhat incentivize you as well..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You can be assure that it does..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She says, placing her palm on your muscular thigh, giving it a firm squeeze like it was ripened fruit. You involuntarily flex it, making Emma grin.<br><br>
<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I can only hope. All I know is that I feel like the luckiest girl alive."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hey, don’t go selling yourself short - you sure do bring a lot to the table."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She says, licking her lips with a wicked smile. You can see the little gears turning in her head.<br><br>
<</if>>
<</if>>
With a very slow and deliberate motion, Emma opens her legs wide into a near-split on the floor, stretching her awesomely sculpted back forward and raising her bulging glutes like a cat.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I do need to stretch now, but maybe I can maximize this if only I had someone to give me a little push..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>With very little concern to the other patrons, you approach Emma from behind, giving her back a push as you let your own groin rub against her firm and toned flesh. You can feel yourself getting moist as you bite your lips almost to the point of bleeding, pulling Emma’s tendons to their very limit as she lets out a soft moan.<br><br>
<<else>>
You look around, concerned about other gymgoers, but everyone seems to be quite focused on their own workouts. You slowly approach Emma’s nicely muscled and inviting back, tentatively placing your two palms to help her stretch. As you do, she lets out a soft moan, and you blush deeply, as she coax you into pushing harder - which you do, begrudgingly.<br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hmmmmm, I knew I could count on you to help me get limber."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
As she says it, she slides into a yoga pose, like she was about to swim on the floor, and then lifts her legs off the ground in an impressive show of dexterity, flexibility and strength as she holds herself off the ground on her hands, legs spread - and her tights leaving very little to the imagination.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I guess all this disciplined training might pay off - and I’m not talking about the demonstration I’ll put on the contest. There are other place all these could come in handy, if you catch my drift."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You gulp, and she lowers herself so she can elegantly get up.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"But right now I have other needs that need to be fulfilled."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She says, as she drags you by the collar into the dressing room. You don’t think you could resist even if you wanted - her commanding tone and actions just disarm you completely. And before you can even say a word, she’s pushed you against your locker, her hand over your shoulder pining you<<if $muscle >55>>, even though you are bigger and stronger, she still manages to somehow completely subdue you<</if>>.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"How about we shower and head back to my apartment, where we can do another type of exercise? I can guarantee it will be quite vigorous and will take your breath away."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You tremble under her, panting already from just imagining what she has in stock for you. You respond with but a silent nod, and Emma hands you a key fob before she goes to take a shower.<br><br>
And so you start a rush to change, go back to your apartment and try to look as presentable as possible, and head to Emma’s apartment.<br><br>
