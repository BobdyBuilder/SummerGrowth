Apparently, there are several projects running late that need to be handed in today, and Emma will have to take over a presentation Mr. Thompson was supposed to have finished - but he just didn’t show up at work and his whole project was not ready.<br><br>You see Emma running past your desk, uncommonly agitated, and you muster all your courage to interrupt her and volunteer.<br><br><span id="choice"><<PersonalityCheck $carefreeCarefull >= 2 "Let me take over for Mr. Thompson, you handle the late projects.">><<replace "#choice">>As you usually keep up with all current projects, you have a pretty good idea of all that is going on.

Even though I wasn’t part of the team, I know it well enough to pick it up and finish the report. But if you are to micromanage all the other late deliveries, it will be hard for you to stay up-to-date and present it properly. Let me handle the presentation."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma is quite taken aback. You know you are offering to carry a huge burden, like some sort of corporate Atlas. She looks deep in your eyes, as if she could measure your mettle just by gazing into your soul.<<if $shyConfident >= 2>>But you stand tall and unflinching, staring back at her resolutely. She can’t even hide her surprise.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Alright, miss <<print $playerLastName>>. I will leave that to you. But you must not disappoint me, do you hear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<else>>You realize you are taking a bit of a risk, and you try your best to give her confidence in your proposal.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"We don’t have many options. I wouldn’t offer this if I didn’t think I could do it. But there isn’t much time to lose, so just give me the go ahead and I’ll do it.

You grab your computer and head to the presentation room. Reaching the shared folder, you find everything Mr. Thompson had already delivered… and it’s not looking great. Your eyes dart around all the confusing data, and you feel a tinge of doubt as you get a proper idea of the size of the mess you got yourself into. But you know how good you are at this, and nothing is going to stand in your way.<br><br>Your fingers deftly fly over the keyboard, tapping furiously as you organize the report, sending the occasional email to members of the team to get clarity on some minor details. Every time you look at the clock, it feels like time has flown much faster than you expected, but you steel yourself and keep focused on the task at hand.<br><br>As you approach your goal, you look at the clock and realize you only have 15 minutes until the presentation. You spend the next 5 minutes going over all the last bits of revision before you go call Emma.<br><br>As you leave the presentation room, your legs are a bit cramped from all the stress - but no time to stretch. You scan around, and it doesn’t take too long to spot Emma’s rather full and imposing silhouette, and you make your way towards her.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Emma. I’m done. There should be enough time to review the presentation before you join me with the client."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma looks back at you, unable to conceal her worry. She goes straight to business, as expected.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Headquarters just called. There is going to be a video conference with all local managers, and I must participate. I won’t be able to review the presentation… and I won’t be there."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You are taken off-guard. Your heart skips a beat - this is a bit beyond what you originally bargained for.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"You can do this, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Go wash your face, and I’ll have the clients meet you in the presentation room. The tall, gray-haired man with a mole on his right cheek is the president, Mr. Clark."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Alright, <<print $playerFirstName>>, it’s not time to panic. You rush to the bathroom, and wash your face as instructed, make sure you are looking your best. Now is the moment of truth. You look in the mirror, and inspect yourself. <<if $shyConfident >= 2>>Somehow, you are surprised - this is not the same small, insecure girl that arrived at this campus not that long ago. You see a grown, confident and experienced woman. You feel like you could take over the world. So let’s go do it!<<else>>Emma trusts you. And this should be enough. You got this.<</if>><br><br>You walk back to the presentation room. You make sure there’s water for everyone, and that the presentation is all queued up. As the clients walk in, you introduce yourself to Mr. Clark, and apologize for Emma’s absence. <<if $muscle >= 80 || $height >= 180>>This presentation might get a little uncomfortable, as the whole delegation seems to have a hard time not staring at your gigantic body. You keep nervously adjusting your clothes, and hope they will actually keep their eyes on the screen for a change. <<elseif $muscle >= 50>>Your physique is probably something businessmen are not quite used to, as you feel somewhat naked with the constant “discreet” (well, that’s what they probably think, at least) stares you keep getting. But you march on, undeterred. <<elseif $muscle >= 35>>One of his underlings, as you give him a handshake, asks you if you work out while he stares at your arm. You give him a nervous smile and nod. <</if>>You proceed through the presentation, explaining just enough to keep it brief, but clear. The client has a few questions, <<if $shyConfident >= 2>>and you have all the answers ready to go, decisively quashing any doubts with precision and confidence.<<elseif $shyConfident >= 0>>and you do your best to answer them, stammering a bit here and there<<else>>making you doubt yourself and freeze. They look at you inquisitively, and you start going over your notes as your heart rate goes through the roof.<</if>>Just then, Emma quietly makes her way into the room. She apologizes for her tardiness, and picks up just in time to finish the meeting. The clients seem very pleased, and thank Emma emphatically as she escorts them to the elevator. Phew! <<if $muscle >= 60>> As they leave, though, you can’t help but overhear one of them comment: “what do they feed their employees here?”<</if>><br><br>As you walk back to your desk, adrenaline still pumping, Emma comes back, looking pleased.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I will let you know, <<print $playerFirstName>>, these are some of our most demanding clients.

Thankfully, your skills allow you to see where you can make the most difference, and you get a hold of the proper stakeholders and send the proper emails so you can make yourself useful.<br><br>It is a gruesome few hours, and everyone is on edge. But as the workday comes to a late close, the team manages to pull a victory by the skin of their teeth. A slightly disheveled Emma gathers everyone at the office.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hello, everyone. I’d like to say a few words to everyone. Despite the curveball we were handed today, you have performed beautifully. Yes, we made some mistakes that led us to this terrible situation, but I was glad to see everyone coming together to deliver the results we needed. I am proud of every one of you. Hopefully, we won’t have to face another day like today… but if we do, I’d like nothing more than to count on a team like this one."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Everyone cheers, but despite her slightly not-perfect hair, Emma seems like her serious everyday self. Sure, you managed to deliver an inordinate amount of work today, but your great bookkeeping skills might have gotten lost amidst the chaos. Pity.<br><br>As you shut down your computer and start getting ready to go home, Emma stops by your desk, and now that you are up close and personal, you can feel that she has got a slight nervous edge to her. I guess she is human, after all, you muse to yourself, suppressing a giggle.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Miss <<print $playerLastName>>. I looked at the deliveries today.

Normally, I would never agree to this, but I am out of options.

If anyone thinks they are unable to deliver, send me an email immediately."<</Dialogue>><br><br>With a plan hatched, you start distributing everyone a job. Looking at the project management software, you decide to switch some people into tasks they are more efficient at. Whenever there is a moment of respite, you start collaborating as well.<br><br>The rest of the day goes by like a flash. There is barely any time to breath, but you seem to be on track to deliver all the late projects by EOB, or close enough that it shouldn’t be a problem.<<else>>You hastily open the project management software, and your eyes scan every task and resource with robotic precision. A vision starts crystallizing in your mind, as you send email after email to each stakeholder, explaining that Emma tasked you with managing the late projects, and giving directions on how to proceed. You ask the proper questions and try to come up with the most efficient way to deliver everything.<br><br>You go after the project leaders, trying to liaise so that you can get the most out of each team. There’s barely any time to waste, but you think you might just pull this off. It’s a constant struggle, with several minor adjustments being made as the day goes by - but you can’t help but smile every time a task is ticked off the board, and one by one the projects are being completed.<br><br>With less than 30 minutes until EOB, you realize two of the projects are going to require people to work a little late, but you should be able to complete them in an acceptable timeframe.<</if>>Proud of your accomplishment, you send everyone a congratulatory email. Morale seems higher than when you started, and it’s hard not to feel a bit proud. And that’s when you see Emma leaving the presentation room, with what seems to be a group of very satisfied clients. She makes her way to your desk, a mix of curiosity and apprehension in her eyes.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Thank you for holding the fort. How did you fare with the projects?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Five of the seven projects were successfully delivered by EOB.

Which I could not have done without your help. Thank you, <<print $playerFirstName>>.

She offers you her hand, and you accept her handshake. Wow, that is SOME grip she has - you literally never remember anyone ever giving you a firmer handshake in your entire life. <<if $muscle >= 45 && $shyConfident > 1>>Your squeeze as hard as you can right back, which doesn’t seem to go unnoticed, and somehow makes her push even harder, Emma’s face completely unfazed.

After you finish your task, you reevaluate and ask the next project leader, jumping from task to task quickly. The task board quickly starts clearing up, and while not all projects will be done by EOB, it looks like they should be ready before the end of the day.<br><br>As the business day comes to a close, you see Emma leaving the presentation room, for the first time with a slightly-less-than-perfectly-professional look. If she looks like that, you figure she must be utterly exhausted. And yet, as soon as the suit-laden entourage boards the elevator, she turns around and gets back to micromanaging everyone, helping increase productivity.<br><br>It is way past everyone’s time to clock out, but finally every project due is turned in. There’s a big commotion as the last one is finished, and the whole team erupts in celebrations, clapping echoing through the fluorescent-lit office. Emma goes to the front of the room, as she calls everyone’s attention.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I am very proud of every single one of you.

As you wait for the attendant to clear the turnstile, you idly look around and something catches your eye: there’s a fairly buff woman doing squats with the most perfect form you’ve ever witnessed. However, it’s not her carefully positioned glutes that call your attention, but her hair. Those short strawberry-blond bangs and that bun look awfully familiar somehow, but you can’t quite place them.<br><br> You make your way to the changing room, where you put your workout leotard on and store your bag in a locker. As you come out, you see that same figure, still facing away from you, on the machine doing calf presses with quite a heavy load. Again, you are slightly mesmerized by the very slow and deliberate motions - most of the gymgoers who set that many plates usually haphazardly repeat the exercises with swinging motions that aren’t very elegant. But this lady just EMANATES focus and discipline. You can’t help but feel a bit jealous.<br><br> As you sit down to perform some concentration curls on a bench, you see the woman finishing her set and grabbing a large bottle, which she shakes before taking a sip.

Despite its muted colors, the functional outfit is surprisingly immodest when compared to your usual idea of business-comes-first Emma. Instead of her usual formal glasses, she dons what looks to be a pretty expensive pair of sports glasses, fastened to her head suggesting she could use them for more than just lifting weights.<br><br> While you always suspected your boss to be in great shape, actually witnessing her in this is a whole other story.

If it wasn’t impolite, you’d be recording her with your phone just to watch it over and over.<br><br>In time, she tries to push herself harder, and that’s when you step in to spot. As she lays down for a bench press, you stand above the loaded barbell, ready to help. Her hands grip the bar, her knuckles white from the effort, as the bar slowly but decidedly is lifted up… and down… you keep your hands floating under it, in case she fails. You can hear Emma breathing harder than usual, yet her movement is consistently rocksteady. While you don’t want to look away from the straining metal rod, you steal some glances at your boss’s face: her eyes are laser focused; her expression the ultimate demonstration of pure concentration.<br><br>Yet she perseveres. Her methodical process continues as she cranks rep after rep, her back arching and her chest inflating in what you can only describe as poetry in motion. It takes some effort on your part to keep your mouth closed and not drool at the absolutely inspirational display of raw effort and strength happening mere <<if $measurementSystem == "metric">>centimeters<<else>>inches<</if>> below your nose.<br><br>However, as she starts her tenth rep, you notice something. It’s subtle, but you see her jaw clenching; her upper arms give a very slight wobble. Her upwards movement, unlike every rep prior, is not smooth and controlled. In a split second, your mind races as you realize how hard she had been pushing herself this whole time without letting the universe know. For the first time ever, you feel like she might actually be inching towards what you never suspected she might have - a limit.<br><br>The bar continues to go up in shaky increments, and your instincts are screaming for you to grab the bar and help her on the last rep, but almost as if you shared some sort of bodybuilding mental link, you restrain yourself, merely letting your palms get closer to the bar. Time slows to a crawl, and seconds feel like minutes as Emma continues to slowly work her way up.<br><br>She manages to lift the bar a bit more than halfway through before you have to step in, the added strength of the two of you completing the motion. Carefully, you two rest the bar back on the stand. Emma’s face is inscrutable, and you try to figure out if she’s proud of her new personal best or disappointed that she needed the spot on that last part. Either way, she stands up, rock-faced, and curtly thanks you for your help.<<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Would you mind if I tagged along with you? I certainly could use a few pointers.<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma’s visage remains stone-cold serious, and you momentarily wonder if you overstepped your boundaries. But then she cracks a small smile, and your shoulders relax.<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>It would be an honor. While I have studied a lot to achieve my goals, I could never had achieved these goals without the help of my mentor. The least I can do is reciprocate with someone else.<</Dialogue>><br><br>You can’t quite pinpoint what has changed, but something about Emma’s demeanor is… different? She still carries herself the same way, but as she goes from exercise to exercise, she takes the time to demonstrate the motions, and watches carefully as you repeat them, giving very clear and well explained corrections. She’s less of a boss and more of a professor, the sports glasses a hilarious contrast, making her seem like the world’s strongest librarian. You follow as the Sancho to her Quixote, stacking plates and helping her wipe after herself.<br><br>As the minutes pass, both of you seem to get a bit more laid back. Eventually, Emma starts nonchalantly posing in front of a mirror, admiring her physique as if you had evaporated. You see it in her eyes, the whole universe is gone, there is only her body and those ever-higher goals she sets for herself. You can’t help it, and unironically clap as you praise her:<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Someday… I’ll be like you. Thanks for being such an amazing teacher and inspiration, Emma.<</Dialogue>><br><br>She snaps out of her trance, and you could swear that you saw her briefly blush. But she just gives you a silent nod and proceeds to thank you for the company.<</if>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That was great, Emma.<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>I won’t lie… I didn’t know what I was missing by always training on my own. Maybe someday we could have a stab at a friendly game of squash? God knows I could use some entertainment after some of the more frustrating workdays.<</Dialogue>><br><br>You try to encourage that idea, without seeming overly eager. Playing with her would certainly be a very interesting challenge!<br><br>You wipe yourself on your way to the shower, looking forward for more opportunities to train with your boss.<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>>         <</replace>>     <</link>>     <<link "I don’t want to take any more of your time.

                Inside the cramped workshop, a giant hunches over a tiny and ancient-looking pedal-powered sewing machine. He has several pins in his mouth, and is calmly working on some unrecognizable article of clothing, spools of fabric surrounding him.<br><br>
                You motion to call his attention, but Emma silently just raises her hand, stopping you. He continues for a whole minute, then, without looking at either of you, he takes the pins off his mouth and announces:<br><br>

            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hello, Simon. Hope you are doing well. Could I bother you to do my friend here a favor?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Simon just nods to acknowledge he heard. You wait awkwardly as Emma briefs him.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"So I’m thinking… maybe a basic boyfriend blazer with matching skirt… <<if $muscle >= 35 || $height > 165>>these legs were not made to be hidden by pants… you have the stockings for that, right?<</if>>"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<if $muscle >= 35 || $height > 165>>Like a deer under headlights, you just nod before you even really think about it. You did not expect Emma to just take charge like that, but there here we go!
            <</if>><br><br>
            Emma continues to explain, and you don’t think you could get a word in edgewise even if you wanted. She speaks and Simon continues doing his work, and the whole situation seems a bit surreal, but you get the impression that this is their usual ritual.<br><br>
            Eventually, Simon puts down the piece he was working on, getting up - wow, you knew he was a big guy, but it’s still a bit of a shock every time you actually witness him standing up. He grabs a bunch of tools and, without a word, puts his hand on your hips and directs you to stand on a little pedestal with some mirrors around it on the corner of the shop.<br><br>
            At this point you kind of already gave up on even voicing any ideas. No matter, because he starts taking your measurements with the kind of precision and speed only someone who’s been doing that their entire life could. <<if $muscle >= 55 || $height > 195>>It’s pretty convenient that he is also in the Extra Large spectrum, allowing him to get around you with ease.<</if>>
            <<if $muscle >= 45 && $height > 180 && fat <= 30>>Wow. Being in the spotlight, getting all measure under the eyes of the pair, and surrounded by mirrors… you can’t help but check yourself out. And as you check your body, you clearly crossed that line where you describe it as a physique instead of shape. Muscles come in like waves, giving you very appealing curves everywhere - you need to control yourself not to get on your tiptoes to check out your calves.<</if>><br><br>
            Before you know it, Simon apparently has memorized all your measurements. He scribbles all of them at once on his yellow legal pad, and Emma continues to give him some last directions as he sketches a little.<br><br>
            As you step down, you just watch the incredible clash of these two opposite personalities. It’s kinda neat, except for the part where you feel like you are invisible. Eventually Simon shows his sketch to Emma, who squints and points a couple of details. Simon licks his thumb, smudges the sketch and redraws those parts and…<br><br>
            Emma just smiles with satisfaction, and that inimitable raised eyebrow, at this time denoting clear approval.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"I’ll have it ready by monday."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Great, put it on my tab, will you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Simon just nods.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wait, Emma, I can’t let you pay for this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Nonsense. You’ve been putting a lot of work lately, I see this as… personal investment on my part."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You are trying to both take a peek at the sketch and object to her gift, but you fail at both. Before you know, Emma has given your personal address for Simon to ship it to you when it’s done.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow, thanks, Emma! This is probably the nicest thing any boss has ever done for me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"No worries, I’ll ensure that you make this worth every cent."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Emma just looks at you with that smug satisfied look, and you can’t help but love and hate it. She will not relinquish control, and it’s weirdly exciting and unnerving.<br><br>
            And with that, you thank Simon and Emma one last time, before heading out.`
