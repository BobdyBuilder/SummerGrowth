Well, here you are in the warehouse. Itâ€™s full of crates and boxes to be move, a PC to log your work on, and the long rods of fluorescent lighting to keep you company. The floor is concrete, the ceiling steel, and you're quite sure that you're the only one coming here. Time to get started!

Those pallets are a bit too heavy to shift, given how tired you are. Maybe take a short break, or lift something lighter.
