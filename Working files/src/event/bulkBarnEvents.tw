        content: 'You spot the Bulk Barn from quite afar: the local supplement store is anything but discreet: the front is nothing but glass, with a smattering of different oversized colorful bottles - and decorated with posters, cardboard cutouts and a video screen of VERY strong people. The message is clear: you wanna get BIG, this is the place to go.<BR><BR>As you approach the entrance, the flashy window becomes a little less appealing: it would seem the many bottles are very haphazardly arranged in no particular order, giving the establishment a somewhat chaotic energy.

Already hooked in,<<else>>extremely intimidating. Hesitantly,<</if>> you step inside.<br><br>Crossing the threshold, you are still somewhat shocked: <<if $carefreeCarefull > 1 || $skills[2].level > 2>>if the outside display looked messy, the interior of the store is downright chaotic, making you feel uneasy as the towers of huge bottles seem stacked in a fashion that could topple like dominoes if someone distractedly bumped on one!<<else>>the interior does not look much better, the merchandise arranged in no particular order or even trying to look neat on their shelves.<</if>> Finding anything specific here seems like a workout in and of itself! But you zig zag your way through the many displays and shelves, as you start to hear a booming voice from the back of the store, despite the blaring music being pumped through the speakers.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"... with the herbal tea, it certainly will help, but you might want to look into creatine - not only I swear by difference it made in my workouts, but I just find it an overall great addition to any diet. Seriously, I’ve been reading on some of the recent research on ergogenic aids, and there are some truly exciting data showing that it might even help with...\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>There is a burly dude, not particularly tall, but VERY strong-looking, behind the counter, loudly speaking AT this confused teen girl, who responds shortly:<br><br><<Dialogue \"randomPerson\" \"Teen girl\">>\"Huh… I just wanted to know if you knew where the coffee shop was, dude!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>She leaves, a mix of intimidation, irritation and just plain confusion. The big guy, however, looks undaunted as he holds his equally large and very sincere boastful smile. You approach tentatively, taking in the full view of what you presume to be the shop owner.<br><br>Wearing a faded heavy metal sleeveless tank top, the balding blonde sports a shallow beard around his toothy grin. His muscular arms wave as frantically as his mouth flapped while talking to the girl, giving him this very energetic and exciting, albeit somewhat intimidating, aura. He follows the girl all the way to the door, still talking about the interactions of caffeine and creatine, completely ignoring your presence in the process. As he comes back, one of his hands taps one of the precariously placed supplement bottles, almost making the whole shelf come down - but his quick reflexes somehow catch it in time, and he just returns the receptacle in an equally precarious position before making his way back to the counter.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Oh! Hey! Didn’t see you there! I’m Edward, but everyone just calls me Big Eddy! I run this here store, the Bulk Barn! We are the premiere location for buying supplements in town, but we also sell all kinds of exercise equipment, if you are so inclined…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He motions towards the big pile of weights in the back, arranged just as randomly as everything else.<br><br><<if $muscle >= 35>><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"You look like you know your stuff, but I am more than happy to help if you have any questions regarding nutrition or supplements. Frankly, I kinda enjoy just talking about fitness, in case you hadn’t noticed. Why, just now, I was having this amazing conversation with a girl about the benefits…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<else>><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"If you have any questions about supplements - or exercise in general - or nutrition, or the latest research, or bodybuilding competitions, or maybe if you want to talk about the latest and greatest metal songs, you’ve come to the right place. I will be happy to answer any questions, give tips, or just talk about it, really.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><</if>>Wow, okay, and you thought Johan was a blabbermouth. Big Eddy is on a roll, and he speaks so fast it’s almost hard to keep up - his tongue seemingly just as strong as any of his limbs. Still, there’s something about his energy that is incredibly inviting and inclusive - motivating, instead of intimidating. Still, right now, you are a bit overwhelmed by it, so you try to answer as politely as you can:<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Huh… I will just browse a bit for now, if you don’t mind? But I promise I will come back to you if I have any questions. Thanks!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Big Eddy rambles on, like a mix between an excitable beagle and Santa Claus on steroids. It’s hard to deny that his enthusiasm is contagious, but your brain is not quite ready to absorb so much information at this speedy rate. Right now, you decide to have a look at what the Bulk Barn has in store.<<set $eddyIntro to true>>'

You walk over and unceremoniously pick it up, unfolding it to see the big “INVOICE” title on top.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Hey, Eddy?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Just a second, I think it might have fallen under this big speaker.

Before you can react, they fall all over, and he puts the speaker down, sighing as he realizes that it wasn’t under that.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Eddy, here!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You extend your hand, displaying the pink invoice page. He still seems to be pondering his next move, despite looking straight at the invoice.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"I wonder if maybe I took it with me when I went to the bathroom?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He asks himself with a pensive frown, hand on his chin.<br><br><<if $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"EDDY!!!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He stops cold, looking at you and finally spotting the document you were trying to show him.<<else>>You look around, unsure how to catch his attention, so you hold the invoice with both hands right in front of his face with a shrug.<br><br><</if>><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Wait, you found it?!?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He nabs the paper from your hands suddenly, and starts inspecting it.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Wow! You are good! Last time it took me two days to find it. Turns out I had tossed it in the trash by mistake with my protein bar wrapping. It was the first place I looked today.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He says, pointing out at the fallen bin, with trash all over the floor.<br><br>Happy to have helped, you figure now might not be the best time to try to make a purchase, and you start heading for the door - but his strong hand grabs your shoulder, making you stop.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Hey, huh, <<print $playerFirstName>>, was it, right?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He looks at you, <<if $muscle >= 35 && $fat < 40>>apparently impressed with your physique.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"You seem like a fitness enthusiast, and I can’t stress how impressed I was just now with you finding that invoice so fast.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<elseif $muscle >= 50>>astounded with your freakishly strong muscles.

What I am trying to say is, I could probably use a hand from someone with some organizational and people skills to run the place. And... well, maybe you would be willing to give it a try?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He looks at you beggingly with puppy dog eyes, and grabs your hand in his. He looks like he might just kneel at any moment.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Listen, it’s not that hard a job. I just need someone to come in, say, wednesday through sunday, from 10 AM to 6PM, and help me run the cash register, organize the backroom... uh... maybe help me stock the shelves, I’ve heard some complaints from clients that it’s a bit hard to find stuff.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Again, you don’t say!!!<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"The pay might start a bit modest, but my intuition is telling me that you are going to help sales a lot. And my intuition is NEVER wrong. I can increase your pay as the store starts doing better. That, and since I need you to help the clients, I will throw in an allowance of supplements every week so you can test the stuff to better advise the clientele. Come on, you COULDN’T POSSIBLY say no to such an offer, am I right?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He complements, whispering under his breath:<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Please say yes?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Big Eddy is really trying to sweeten the deal. And frankly, it does sound somewhat tempting: if you are intent on pursuing fitness as an interest, this is definitely a no-brainer - you are bound to learn more about nutrition and fitness at the job, and take home some supplements on top of that? Sure, it’s bound to be a lot of work, given Eddy’s... uh... lax organizational skills? And dealing with his larger-than-life personality might seriously be an issue if you have to hang out with him for several hours every day. Hmmmm...<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Wow, that’s actually a very generous offer, but I wonder if maybe you are overestimating my abilities a bit?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Are you kidding me? I have a GREAT eye for people, kiddo. Listen to me right now: you are destined for great things. I am the one who would be humbled to have you working with me. And when it comes to nutrition and exercise, if you have anything left to learn, I vow to teach you everything I know in time.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"I am not sure you need another salesperson, you seem to be pretty good at it yourself, Eddy!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"HA! There’s a reason people joke that I should’ve been a cheerleader. Pep is my middle name! Well, not literally. But maybe I should change that legally someday! And, I mean, if I rearrange the letters upside-down, I could write peppy with the letters in Eddy. Or would I be missing one P? Still, my motivation is certainly better than my grammar!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>There he goes into another ramble. But it is undeniable, the more he speaks, the more he stirs excitement inside you. The very idea of working with him is a mixture of daunting and exciting, and before you know...<span id="choice"><<link "Accept it">><<replace "#choice">><<set $bulkBarnJob to true>><<set $job to true>><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"OK, you got me, I can’t say no to that!

He seems very sincere about it, but you can’t say if that’s just his hyperbolic nature or if he really sees something extraordinary about you. Either way, you’d rather just maintain your relationship with him as salesman/client for the time being.<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Still, thanks for the compliment.

Yeah, that should work!<</if>><br><br>You decide to start moving the weights. <<if $muscle >= 60>>It’s a big anticlimactic that you can just casually move them with little to no effort. <<elseif $muscle >= 45>>You are strong enough that it’s basically a trivial task to move them, which makes the job a lot easier.<<elseif $muscle >= 30>>It takes some effort to move the large weights, but it’s a testament to your progress that you manage to do so by yourself, even if it’s hard to handle the bigger one.<<else>>You manage the smaller ones just fine, but you need to recruit Big Eddy to help with the bigger ones, which he does with pleasure and excitement.<</if>><br><br>Wow! It looks great, seeing the weights all organized by size and type! Next, you tackle the aerobics stuff. Given its colorful nature, you enjoy making the display all color-coded - which is both practical AND visually appealing! This is turning out to be more fun than you expected!<br><br>Finally, there’s only the electronics, tools, and mirrors left. For this, you try to find a balance and make it look like a high-end store, given all the chrome and reflective surfaces. By the time you are done, it looks REALLY GOOD.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Eddy\" \"Eddy\">>\"Nice job, girl. Keep it up!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He says, giving you the thumbs up. You shoot another one back with a wink, feeling very fulfilled.'

            <</if>>
            Big Eddy sucks air through his teeth as he squints, like he was bracing for something… no, more like he’s catching his breath in preparation to unleash something exciting. He’s like an excitement balloon, filling up in preparation to pop with something extraordinary. Which he does, raising a poster from behind the counter, as he announces even more energetic than usual.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"TA-DAH! See this poster here? This is my pet project, the little baby I’ve been working on for the last few months!

            He flashes the big colorful poster, which is just as energetic as him (and also happens to display how horrible his design skills are). You look at it, as Eddy nods with a big smile and very buggy eyes, anxiously waiting for your reaction.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Bodybuilding competition? That’s some very serious business, Eddy, I’m an amateur at best."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            He honestly thinks you have a shot at this. Part of your brain is thinking about how hard you imagine a competition like this could be. But at the same time, he’s not wrong - your changes lately make this seem like such an obvious path. That, and it’s hard to disappoint Big Eddy when he makes the puppy eyes like this.<br><br>

                        That is all a bit too much, too fast. You feel your head spinning with the prospect, and even though you don’t want to disappoint someone so sweet, you end up breaking the bad news as nicely as you can:<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, Eddy, I’m REALLY flattered that you think I have the potential, but it just isn’t the right time for me.

                        You fully expected Big Eddy to look downright miserable and dejected at your refusal, but you vastly underestimated his positive vibe.<br><br>

                        You respond with a pout. Again, Big Eddy responds with a big laugh and a very forceful slap on your back.<br><br>

                        And out of nowhere he just gives you a very warm and affectionate hug. <<if $shyConfident < 0>>It’s a bit weird, but you know he means well, and awkwardly rest your arms sort of around him.<<else>>Not only is he obviously very touchy-feely, but there’s this contagious energy that just makes you feel good about yourself, as you return with an equally tight hug.<</if>>

                        He says with a wink, making you incapable of not smiling - despite the underlying guilt you still feel for knowing that, deep inside, you disappointed him. Oh, well, maybe in another timeline, you’ll compete and make him proud.”

                        Eddy is downright vibrating with excitement, and you are not sure you’ll manage to get a word in edgewise. He is very obviously taking this super seriously, and will probably want to do much more than just sponsor you financially - it would appear he has a lot in store to help you out… assuming he can actually organize all the stuff he is daydreaming about - which, given his planning skills, could be a bit hit or miss.<br><br>
                        Still, the idea hasn’t quite hit you yet - you really are doing this. He writes down your personal information and promises to take care of all the bureaucracy to enroll you into the competition. You have butterflies in your stomach, as you envision yourself in a bikini onstage, a mix of excitement and nerves.<br><br>

            And when he utters the A word, you see Big Eddy’s ear perk up in the back. He drops the magazine he was reading, stands up in a flash, and before you know it, he’s materialized in front of Johan.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"So, my boy, you came here to get started on your fitness journey?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            With little ceremony, Eddy nabs the drawing from Johan’s hand. It shows a rather slim but toned martial arts, with a short-sleeved gi that reveals his forearms and some of the chest.<br><br>

            Johan’s eyes sparkle. He’s gobbling it all up, and Eddy is also basking on the attention. Another customer comes in, so you leave them as you go work on a bunch of other tasks.<br><br>
            …<br><br>
            It’s been over an hour by the time you get back to that pair. They are both still talking, a million miles an miles, with a matching level of excitement.<br><br>

            You never quite gave it enough thought about how similar those two are, but now you can’t unsee it.

You sit down on your chair and just keep watching as they spend yet another hour talking about their hobbies excitedly to each other. You will not be surprised if they completely forget the original cosplay and fitness plan by the time they are done…`

            Her eyes still dart around, and you try your best to try and gleam what she intends to do. She’s obviously not preying upon the mass-endowed clientele, or even doing anything close to harassing you. No, she has another endgame that you can’t quite put your fingers on yet.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Products are kinda pricey, huh? But how much growth can you actually get from it? Can you give a weight per dollar spent estimate?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Oh, she’s plotting, no doubt. But what? Your fingers start fidgeting, as the uncertainty of her chaos could manifest at any point. Is she going to harass your customers? Just stockpile the merchandise (or, worse, try to come with some crazy scheme to barter for it)? You don’t want to involve Eddy, because you feel like these two personalities won’t quite mesh - he’s just TOO NICE to deal with Kris.<br><br>
            You hand her a generic informative flier about the products sold there, which she inspects with uncommon attention. And just as quietly as she entered, she leaves, absorbing the secrets of the leaflet. Phew! Disaster averted... right?<br><br>
            <<if $muscle >= 45>>But just as you turn around, you feel something climbing over your back, almost making you lose your balance.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hmmmm, this job you got here seems to be helping. You feeling BEEFY, girl!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                She exclaims, while squeezing your shoulders. <<if $carefreeCarefull > 1>>You take a deep breath, walk out of the store, and lean until she lets go.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, at MY place of work, we’ll need some boundaries, OK?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<else>>You try to reach and get her down, but she’s there like a tick! You complain with some choice words until she finally dismounts, having inspected the ‘merchandise’ properly and feeling satisfied, and leaves as quickly as she came in.<br><br> 
                <</if>> 
                Well, at least you can’t complain that it was a slow day!

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You turn to find your workout partner, wearing a very cute summer dress, and despite her muscularity, looking 300% out of place inside the Bulk Barn, which just boggles the mind any way you cut it.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Hey, <<print $playerFirstName>>, I hope I’m not intruding, showing up at your workplace..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
A sudden look of horror comes to her face.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, no! I’m intruding, am I not? //Mi dispiace!!!// In the middle of your workday - you are going to get in trouble, I shouldn’t have come, I’m so sorry!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She starts leaving in a hurry, <<if $shyConfident < -1>>and you try to say something, but she’s like a scared bird, and is almost out of the store when Big Eddy materializes in front of her, making her jump back with an ‘Eek!’ and falling down on her behind, making several shelves shake - and giving you a near-heart attack, but thankfully, no products fall.
<<else>>
You grab her by her wrist, and insist that it’s alright.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, chill! There isn’t that much movement in a supplement store, so it’s not like I’m not doing my job. Besides, having someone of your, huh… //stature//… is probably the best advertising we can have!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her eyes bug out at the thought of that - her being ADVERTISING for the store? As in, people LOOKING at her?!? She’s like a scared bird, running straight for the door. And she is almost out when Big Eddy materializes in front of her, making her jump back with an ‘Eek!’ and falling down on her behind, making several shelves shake - and giving you a near-heart attack, but thankfully, no products fall.
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"Oh, I’m so sorry, lady! I have a bad habit of just popping up in front of people. Let me give you a hand!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
The scene is almost comical: a fairly short and very muscular dude, offering his hand to what can best be described as a shy and dainty giantess. Elena blushes and covers her face, but somehow Big Eddy’s smile seems to melt right through that, and she raises her hand delicately. It doesn’t take a physics professor to realize that, extremely strong as the smaller Big Eddy (yes, the irony is not lost on you) may be, he just lacks the mass to counterbalance giving Elena a hand up. So you discreetly help push her up from behind as he pulls her hand.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"WOW, YOU’RE HUGE! Dang, girl, how come you don’t shop here? I feel almost embarrassed that you got these results without ever buying from us! Still, kudos!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Eddy is literally clapping as he smiles, and Elena seems to shrink 3 sizes unto herself, and turn a light shade of purple. That was definitely not the attention she wanted to bring onto herself.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, Eddy, this is Elena. She’s a friend of mine, and maybe you noticed, but she’s a bit on the shy side!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"What? Shy?!? You kiddin’ me? I am not sure I could envision anyone bigger! I’m pretty sure our entire clientele would be jealous of her! So no worries, Elena, you are doing just peachy!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena once again cradles her face inside her hands, taking a step back in silence. You put a hand so she doesn’t run into one of the precariously-arranged shelves, as you shush in her ear. With your other hand, you make a neck-cutting gesture as you look with an angry face at Eddy, trying to discreetly tell him to CUT IT OUT!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"But seriously, girl, this is a no-judgment zone here. You can just chill, I’ll be in the back, but if you ever want to share some of your routines and diet, I am DYING to know what your tricks are! So, again, congrats!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And with that, Eddy walks into the back room, humming excitedly. You wrap your arms around Elena, telling her it’s okay and it’s only the two of you there now.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, hey, are you alright?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She looks less hurt and more embarrassed at herself for the way she handled that.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"He seems... very nice. It’s just... //è troppo//... a bit much."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, you basically just described Big Eddy. But I can guarantee, he’s the nicest guy you ever meant, and he really means well. He’s just… a bit, huh, //troppo//!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You butchering of Italian makes Elena laugh, and she comes out of her shell. With the situation disarmed, she says she just wanted to see your work and hang out for a bit, and that’s exactly what you two do for the next half hour.<br><br>
You will just have to give Big Eddy a little lesson in handling Elena if she ever decides to visit again.`

        content: `Finally! You cleaned all the dust in the stockroom. But now you are soooo bored. You start flicking paper balls on the trashcan, sighing as you start getting increasingly restless. Your legs shake, and you end up pacing through the store impatiently. There’s just too much energy and you gotta DO SOMETHING!<br><br>
And then your eyes stop at the weights on sale. Hmmmmm... maybe if you tire yourself, this might help pass time?<br><br>
You sit down on the bench, and look at all the weights available. <<if $muscle >= 80>>You end up grabbing the loaded barbell, which is there mostly for display, given the inordinate amount of weight loaded as a sort of prop. It’s enough for serious lifters to have second thoughts about doing squats with it. YET...<br><br>
With the weight in hand, you stand up, and start doing barbell biceps curls. Wow, you’ve really been getting strong. Your arms get more pumped with each rep, enormous globes of power adorned with veins that make it seem to have a life of its own.
<<elseif $muscle >= 60>>
You see the loaded barbell, which is there mostly for display, given the inordinate amount of weight loaded as a sort of prop. It’s enough for serious lifters to have second thoughts about doing squats with it. Well, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?<br><br>
You grab the bar, and attempt a Romanian deadlift. You feel that characteristic burning on the back of your legs, but it feels perfectly doable. It FEELS right. You keep pulling as many reps as you can, biting your lips as you feel your muscles tighten and harden. After you are done, you check yourself in the mirror, and the pump is real. You lower body looks pretty amazing as your turn your back to watch your progress.
<<elseif $muscle >= 45>>You grab one of the heavier dumbbells, which is fully loaded to look cool, and you attempt a concentration curl. OOF! It’s a lot of weight, and you grit your teeth and start sweating - it burns, but you are so obstinate to pull it off, you just keep slowly raising the rod. It feels like it takes forever, and your arm really burns… but you eventually bring the weight all the way up!<br><br>
You let out an excited WHOOP, but you lack the wherewithal or force to bring it down carefully, and it falls hard on the soft mat, making a loud THUD! You massage your arm, but you aren’t going to let your other arm not join in the fun! And so you proceed to repeat the feat.
<<elseif $muscle >= 30>>
You load up a couple of dumbbells, and lay down on the bench, pressing them to test your pecs. You seem to have slightly overestimated your own strength, and after a couple of reps, your arms are shaking wildly and you decide to give up before you make a mess.
<<else>>You grab one of the colorful starter dumbbells, and just keep cranking reps idly as you continue with your routine. It’s not much, but you are relentless in your little routine. A long while later, your upper arms feel much firmer than you ever remembered. In fact, after you stop, you quickly move the big metal chair back, and it feels weirdly... lighter?
<</if>><br><br>
Big Eddy comes back into the store, and looks at you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Eddy" "Eddy">>"Hey, there, kiddo! You look like you are glowing! Did you put some makeup on or something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Heck, yeah! I was hitting the weights here in, and I feel AWESOME!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You give your pumped muscles a flex, showing off to him. Big Eddy smiles and shows a double thumbs-up. Man, he’s so great at motivation it’s not even funny!”
<<else>>You blush, and try to explain that you were just messing around with the weights. Eddy winks approvingly, and you slump into the corner, slightly embarrassed... but also weirdly proud!”
