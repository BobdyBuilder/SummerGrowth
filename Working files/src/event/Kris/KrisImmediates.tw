    You both comment in unison:<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Wow."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    There’s a moment of silence, before she says, tentatively:<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I must have your gigantic biceps, show me how much stronger than me you are."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<else>>
    She grabs your upper arms with her hungry hands, and starts squeezing them with enough force that she could probably crush an apple. Thankfully, your biceps are much, MUCH firmer.<br><br>
    <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Flex for me, now!!!."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You first."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say, in a provocative tone.<br><br>
Kris smirks, and lays down on your torso, showing you her own biceps. Again, she’s not that big… but a very pronounced ball raises from her thin arms. You find it quite scrumptious.<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 2>>
    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Now let me show you what a real woman looks like…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

    You say, in a teasing tone.
<<else>>
    You bite your lips, and it’s your turn to feel mischievous.
<</if>>
Wrapping your shoulder around her, you place your arm next to hers. Immediately, the sheer girth of your relaxed arm is already a stark contrast… but you haven’t even started. You just ball your fist, then bend your elbow to the same position. And now, very slowly, you start the slowest flex of your biceps you have ever performed. The mountain rises, like an erupting volcano, completely eclipsing Kris. <<if $muscle > 60 && fat < 35>>And much like a mountain, it has a magnificent and defined peak at the top, along with valleys of definition where it meets your triceps and deltoids.<</if>><br><br>
Unable to resist, Kris once again unleashes her tongue, just lubricating your entire arm with her saliva. She hungrily raises herself and places her hands on your shoulder and elbow, consuming your biceps like a lustful piece of corn on the cob. She licks and nibbles at first, but eventually starts biting harder and harder. <<if $muscle > 60>>It just makes you instinctively flex harder, and you two start a tug of war between teeth and muscle as she bites harder - but you, expectantly, emerge victorious… but just in the sense that you are harder, because both of you tremble and climax once again. 
<<else>>It hurts a bit… but it is also strangely erogenous. You don’t dare relax, as she just digs her teeth in. You can’t say who is getting the most pleasure out of it, but you really couldn’t beg for more.
<</if>>
You can feel the heartbeats from Kris laying on your, her blood about to boil. Maybe it’s time for the main attraction.<br><br>

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That’s a good girl. How about I give you a little reward now?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You stand up, holding Kris up by the armpits with ease. She is momentarily confused, but clearly very aroused. You pin her against the wall, and dig into her mound with your tongue, finding it completely gushy from all the foreplay. She squirms and struggles, every muscle in her body spasming as you study her vagina to learn what makes her tick. She is no more than a doll in your hands, and you both find that fact incredibly arousing.<br><br>
            It doesn’t take much longer for the two of you to climax once more. Sweaty and exhausted, you still hold her up against the wall.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Are… huff… are you going to let me down? Puff!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            Kris proves that her tongue is capable of so much more than just worshiping your muscles and height. Finding your pussy already very wet, she really digs in, moving over each and every erogenous crevice like a professional spelunker. But it’s not about how deep and voraciously she goes - no, she seems to react to your every squirm, making you arch your back as she sends jolt after jolt of pleasure up your spine. You moan and shake, until she brings you to a climax once again, shaking very strongly for a full ten seconds. And then you go limp, fulfilled and exhausted, as she turns around and rests her nose against yours.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Was that to your liking?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            With wide eyes, you nod emphatically as you catch your breath.

<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hello, there, sweet cheeks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Huh? How did you know I was…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Before you can complete your sentence, Kris is hurrying you inside. She directs you to the middle of her living room, and she leaves, dimming the lights on her way to her bedroom.<br><br>
You wait a few seconds, still thinking about what to say when…<br><br>
Kris comes out of her room with this skimpy black and red babydoll - the see through piece looks ridiculously big in contrast to her small stature, as she holds it up to your eye level<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Let’s see how good I am at guessing the size of my little sex toy…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>You nab the piece from her hands with an aggressive swipe, and she starts hyperventilating.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Who said you earned the right to dictate what I wear? Also, let me make something clear - I am no one’s toy… but… I AM willing to take you as my little side project for a casual evening of fun…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > -1>>You take the sensual article of clothing in your hand, inspecting it carefully. <<if $shyConfident > 1>>Yes, it is quite sexy and a lot of fun, and you are eager to try it on.<<else>>This VERY transparent piece of clothing is a bit too racy for your taste (is that a hole where your… oh my…!), but you see how eager Kris looks, and figure it might be worth a try.<</if>>
<<else>>Kris pushes the delicate nightgown into your hands, and starts fidgeting, her expression of thirst and anticipation reinforced by the puffs of hot vapor coming from her mouth. Unable to say no to her, you start undressing.
<</if>><br><br>
You decide to go change in the bathroom, where not only you get some extra privacy, but you get to make a splash when you reveal yourself. Closing the door behind you, you undress, looking at yourself in the mirror. Well, if Kris likes big girls, she is certainly in for a treat! <<if $muscle >65 || $height >195>>You are actually surprised that the gown is a bit too small, having to struggle a bit to fit it on your torso and hips given how easy it could tear.<<else>>The babydoll fits just right, and makes you wonder how Kris managed to guess that… but then again, you have a sneaky suspicion she could recite your measurements on a whim.<</if>><br><br>
You check yourself again in the mirror. <<if $shyConfident > 1>>Damn, you looking fucking SIZZLING in this!<<else>>You feel a little out of your element, but you’d be lying if you said it didn’t really bring out your developed physique.<</if>> Your muscular arms and legs are fully exposed, while your breasts are comfortably housed in the underwires, and majestically displayed in the see-through cups, playing second fiddle to your burgeoning pecs. Your abs are delectably hinted behind the mesh, leaving just enough to the imagination. But the real show is reserved for the lower part, tastefully emphasized by the red detailing, with a hole revealing your glorious pubic mound. You find your own mouth salivating a bit at your own sight, modesty be damned!<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>You slowly open the door just a bit, and reveal the tips of your fingers, slowly raising them all the way over the door. You put a leg out, stretching your foot to show a fully pumped calf - and then, placing your foot on the ground, you reveal a massive thigh. At this point, you can hear Kris and hear heavy breathing.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You better behave, or I am stopping this right now, you hear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You hear a loud GASP, and the breathing becomes more faint. Good, it confirms that you have full control of her drawstrings. You put out an extended arm, with its respectably defined forearm, which you slowly raise as your upper arm comes along an ground-breaking biceps flex. You hook your calf around the door, and then rest your back against the edge of the door, your glutes making quite a splash as you reveal yourself in the babydoll.
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > -1>>You open the door quickly, revealing your body, and Kris’s eyes almost pop out of her skull. You raise your arms and pull a slow and seductive squat, your head turned sideways with a lustful expression to tease her. Kris nearly falls from her chair, but you shake your finger in a “no” sign as you wink at her seductively.  
<<else>>You meekly open the door, Kris howls at you, falling to her knees from the chair she was sitting on, and crawling all the way to you. She starts caressing your calves, and you find yourself standing at the tip of your toe, making the muscle explode under her hands. It’s a bit much for her, and she falls back, squirming and reaching for her crotch. You take a step back, giving yourself some space - her sheer admiration is actually a huge turn on, and you find yourself getting wet as well… but maybe you need to pace yourself a bit here.
<</if>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, what do you think? Do I look good in this?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris does respond, but it is little more than an incomprehensible groan of pleasure.<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You are to respond when spoken to, am I clear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Your voice booms with command, and Kris is shocked into attention, her posture going right up.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"YES, MA’M!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Good. Don’t make me remind you… or I might have to punish you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris gulps, and you are pretty sure she is divided between following your order… and the prospect of punishment. But enough for the stick… time for the carrot.
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > -1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well… I think I look pretty good… I’d say, enough to be adored… maybe even… worshiped?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<else>>You let an amused giggle escape, as your hands explore the statuesque body on display.
<</if>><br><br>
You arch your arms up and put a leg forward, giving your entire physique a major pump that greatly emphasizes your hourglass shape, and makes you look like a classic sculpture..
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I do feel like a Greek goddess… in fact, maybe I look even better than those statues…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> 
You stretch one arm as you flex the other on a heavenward pose, making your biceps boom.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’d be willing to bet I’m bigger… and harder… than any of them. So… "<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Systematically, you start pumping every muscle group in seductive repeated motions, engorging every muscle little by little until they reach their full potential. You feel yourself getting warmer, bigger, harder… and wetter. MUCH wetter.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"This blood… it blesses each and every part of my body - making me grow before your very eyes… do you wonder just how big I can get?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You turn your face and gaze deep into Kris’s eyes. Her skin is dripping with sweat, and you would not be surprised if she just started melting. You aren’t quite done yet, though… maybe it’s time to get a bit creative…<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 2>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I COMMAND YOU TO START MASTURBATING FOR YOUR GODDESS. I WANT TO SEE YOU FINGERING YOURSELF FURIOUSLY, PLEASURING YOURSELF AT MY DIVINE SIGHT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
With no hesitation, Kris digs her hand forcefully into her pants, as she brings her middle and ring fingers from her other hand into her mouth. Her face turns red instantly, and she starts heaving up and down, her eyes inexorably stuck to your continuous posing.<br><br>
You alternate between looking at your every hardened muscle, covered by the glistening sheen of sweat, and Kris’s undisputed lustful adoration. <<if $muscle >65 || $height >195>>As your blood pumps your entire body to ridiculous proportions, you feel the babydoll ripping, and you give it an extra flex to tear it into two as you roar, making Kris massage her clitoris even more furiously, and bringing her other hand to stimulate her now fully-erect nipples.<</if>><br><br>
You can feel Kris is on the verge of climaxing.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"STOP!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You order with the undisputed authority you deserve, and Kris freezes, still trembling from the mounting desire.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You are not allowed to cum without my say-so!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
And with that, you walk, fierce like a lioness, putting one thunderous thigh in front of the other, and you lift Kris up by her collar in the air. With uninterrupted eye contact, you rip her pants off with your free hand, and start fingering her.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You may now touch my arms as I toy with you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
With no hesitation, Kris reaches for your tensed forearms, biceps and triceps. You smile as you explore her wet pussy with your middle and index fingers, your thumb resting on her V-shaped trimmed bush, feeling her squirm under your absolute control.
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > -1>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Let’s take this to the next level… you may still not touch ME… but how about you get yourself off and tell me how amazing I am?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris stutters for a second as you resume your little show. You continue posing, but all you can see if her, fingering herself with the fury of a thousand suns, as she gazes deep into your soul and proclaims her adoration loudly:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"You are so strong, so beautiful… pure perfection in female form… hmmmmmmm… and you make me so wet and horny… you truly are a goddess. I live to serve you… I want to feel your… (ugh) power… your incomparable strength… (huff)... those hard as diamond muscles… Ahhhhhh!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You continue flexing harder and harder, tensing as you feel yourself getting equally aroused… to the point where it’s getting hard to maintain your composure. <<if $muscle >65 || $height >195>>As your blood pumps your entire body to ridiculous proportions, you feel a ripping propagating through the taut babydoll, which sends your thrall over the edge.<</if>><br><br> Kris starts viciously squirming as her pussy gushes, and you find yourself joining her in her climax - a more controlled and dignified tremor, as you bite your lip in ultimate carnal desire.  
<<else>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So… is that what you call worshiping? I’m frankly a bit disappointed…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say with a pout, and Kris immediately springs on you like a lynx in heat, wrapping herself around your barely-covered torso as her fingers explore your entire body. In time, you flex each and every muscle she decides to caress, the hardening sending jolts through the girl - and making her start an uncontrollable dry-humping. She rips the babydoll off of you, and soon she can’t help herself and just puts her tiny hand deep into your pussy, fingering you as she sucks your nipples with unmatched ardor.<br><br>
The two of you squirm in unison, your back arching as she accelerates both the touching and the sucking, and as you approach your climax, she just nibbles your fully-erect nipples. You start shaking so hard from the explosion of pleasure that Kris almost latches off, but her hand digs deep into your back, her nails failing to pierce the rock-hard wings of your wide posterior.
<</if>>
Kris eventually just tumbles onto the ground, completely spent. Frankly, you are not too far behind, but you make a point in keeping your posture as imposing as you can. You watched the puddle of what’s left of her, fingers still slightly trembling. You return to the bathroom to put your clothes back on, and make your way out of the apartment, as you exclaim:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I hope you enjoyed that… I know I sure did!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>`

So you give Kris a ring, and she sounds quite eager to receive you in her apartment for some naughty fun. You make your way there, curious about why she sounded so eager - well, MORE eager than usual.<br><br>
You knock on her apartment door, but it just slides open, revealing a mostly dark interior. Huh. There is only a spotlight shining on top of the mostly empty dinner table.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris? You there?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You can’t hear anything other than the moody soundtrack she seems to have set up - her selection of “Down on the Street” by The Stooges couldn’t be more her vibe - but still surprisingly sexy. You make your way in, and you notice that there is a small note on the lone pillow over the rather large table. It reads simply, in her surprisingly nice calligraphy:<br>
Clothes off - get on the table<br><br>
You oblige, stripping down to your birthday suit, and lay down with your head on the pillow. The air feels electric somehow, your anticipation building as you find yourself quite aroused - a feeling that is quickly communicated by your hard nipples and your now fully erect penis, which stands proud and tall - almost like a romantic candle near the middle of the table.<br><br>
You hear a creak, and the door to the bathroom opens. You raise your head a bit to check, and you can see Kris, wearing only a kitchen apron and a cook hat - and bringing a small wheeled cart with her. You hear the wheezing sound of the cheap piece of furniture, and it makes a shiver go up your spine - what does this crazy girl have in mind? She installs herself by your side, and without saying a word, nuzzles and kisses your neck seductively, making you squirm.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m guessing I’m the main course today?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris smiles, and puts her finger on her lips, shushing you into silence. She slips a small mask over your eyes, leaving you completely in the dark. Normally, you would feel slightly afraid, but there’s something about the way she reveres and adores you that gives you a strange sense of confidence. You hear some rustling as she preps her little wheeled table… and you smell a very sweet aroma.<br><br>
You get a sudden jolt as Kris starts teasing your nipples with a feather, making your entire body harden even more - not only your nipples and dick, but also your muscles as you tense yourself with the soft touch of her light instrument. Kris draws circles over your areola, and then goes over your stomach, playing with your belly button - which you never realized was so sensitive before. 
<<if $muscle >=40>>
She proceeds to use the tip of her finger to very softly contour your cobblestone abs, and then the ridge of your biceps and triceps, before giving it a nice squeeze. <</if>>
You suspect this is just her surprisingly patient foreplay, as you hear some different noises you can’t quite comprehend, like sloshing and clacking. And then, all of a sudden, you feel something slightly cold and wet around your newly-acquired penis accompanied by the hissing sound of an aerosol can. The smell of vanilla, sugar and butter fills the air. You hear some more squirting… you find yourself slightly contorting from all these touches, biting your lips  and using all your willpower to resist removing the mask. Finally, you feel a light touch on the very tip of your dick.<br><br>
Kris removes your mask, and proudly points towards her masterpiece: she has covered your man-meat in whipped cream beautifully, with colores sweet sauces around it… and a cherry on top. She grins, as she uses her tongue to circle the head of your dick methodically, sending lightning through all of your body - and then she cups the cherry with her tongue and moves it inside her cheeks for a few seconds… before spitting its stem in a knot. Oh, God! You can just imagine what that tongue is about to do to you…!<br><br>
<<if $muscle >=40>>She leans both hands on your abs, testing how sturdy they are, and pants with excitement as she realizes she has a rock-hard surface to lean against. 
<</if>>She opens her mouth wide, and starts licking her cocksicle creation carefully, starting at your pubis. Gently, she circles the very base of the shaft, and you find yourself tensing every muscle in your body at once, as she spirals her way up. It takes quite the effort for you not to just stand up, but you resist, as she slurps the sweetened whipped cream, giving each protruding vein in your dick extra attention. As she goes round and round, she gives your thighs a very firm squeeze, and takes a deep breath before holding the base of your penis very firmly, using her amazingly dexterous tongue to lash the head of your new organ! Pulling back your foreskin, she uncovers it, and very aggressively starts twirling her tongue around its circumference - creating an indescribable ball of pent-up energy deep within your being as you seem to approach the edge of climaxing. But she squeezes the base of your penis once again, edging you more and more, as she repositions herself on your side…<br><br>
She looks at you with the naughtiest grin, and you are unable to say anything, just holding all that inside of you and begging for release with your eyes. But she’s not quite done yet - Taking a very deep breath, she just goes to town, deep-throating your entire dick! 
<<if $tempDickErect >= 30 && $tempDickGirth >= 30>>
Your absurdly meaty appendage, however, proves to be too much, and she’s close to dislocating her jaw - yet she perseveres, putting as much of the head inside her mouth as she can, while she hugs your gigantic tool, rubbing it up and down with her breasts. You squirm as she mounts your waist, legs astride, riding you and sucking your dick like a professional cowgirl trying to tame a wild horse. Your shaking and contorting increases, but she holds on like her life depended on it, and continues sucking harder… and faster… and harder and faster… AND HARDER AND FASTER… OHGODOHGODOHGOD!!!

Your absurdly meaty appendage, however, proves to be too much, and she’s close to dislocating her jaw - yet she perseveres, putting as much of the head inside her mouth as she can, and uses her hands to caress the veiny shaft as her tongue continues to stimulate it as much as she is able to.

Before you can fully process it, you just explode in a shower of cum, and Kris hungrily slurps and swallows every drop she can. Your body starts going limp, and Kris wipes her mouth while she smiles at you. But somehow, you feel like she’s not quite done yet. You try to catch your breath as she reaches under her wheeled cart once again, and you wait for your blood circulation to normalize…<br><br>
As you start coming back to your senses, you see Kris bring out something in her hand… she lays it out next to your now flaccid penis, and looks at it very intently. It turns out, she’s measuring how you compare to her very own strap-on: a very girthy, long and veiny rubber implement, attached to a belt.<br><br>
<<if $tempDickErect >= 30 && $tempDickGirth >= 20>>
You see her shedding a small tear as she realizes that your penis actually exceeds the specifications of her toy. In what shocks you as a very unexpected twist, she gives it a melancholy kiss and whispers goodbye, tossing it away as she lays back down on your chest and playfully slides her hand over your di… her new toy.<br><br>

<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Now, the Grand Finale - RAM ME LIKE YOU MEAN IT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You get up from the table, and lay a fingertip where her hamstrings meet her glutes, feeling the supple skin of her butt. You can’t deny, for someone that small, her ass amazingly hot.<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1 && $muscle >= 45>>
You grab Kris by her sides and lift her clean off the ground, pushing her hard against the wall as you proceed to ram her ass with force, nibbling on her ear. You put actual force into her tight asshole, and she gasps and moans with every decided thrust. She’s like a little doll in your big hands, and you whisper as you make sudden and strong thrusts:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is that what you want, huh? Or do I need to go HARDER?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
In between moans, she BEGS you to go harder:<br><br>

Kris just bites her lips and tightens her fists, you can literally see her glutes tensing as you jab into her asshole with force. She moans squirms, and you keep going, surprised at how tight she is. You thrust faster and harder as you go along.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is that what you want, huh? Or do I need to go HARDER?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
In between moans, she BEGS you to go harder:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oh! HARDER! I want you to FUCK ME RAW!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You comply, putting all your weight into it, breaching her orifice as hard as you can. You can feel Kris climaxing as you continue… and then a second time.<br><br>
<<else>> 
This is new territory for you, and you tentatively brace yourself against her. Taking a deep breath, you penetrate her asshole, and you can hear Kris gasping. It stuns you for a second, but she moans with pleasure, and it gives you confidence to keep going. Slowly, you work up your speed and go harder and harder, making Kris react accordingly. You keep ramming until she climaxes, and you let go of her.<br><br>
<</if>>
Kris just falls to the ground, completely spent and satiated. 
<<if $muscle >=35>>You carry her back to bed, and cover her.
<</if>>
You watch her content smile under her closed eyes, face completely covered in sweat. Her breathing is still ragged, but she couldn’t look any happier. You run your hand through her hair and give her a quick peck on the forehead before putting your clothes back on… and stealing her bottle of whipped cream on your way out.`

Arriving at the door, you try the doorknob, and find the door (unsurprisingly) locked. <<if $submissiveDominant > 1 && $muscle >= 70>>With a smirk, you just force it open, and the solid wood around the handle cracks with ease, the knob left with an imprint of your mighty hand.<br><br>
<<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1 && $muscle >= 50>>You brace yourself firmly to the ground, and apply significant pressure on the handle, your legs and arms flare up as you hear a satisfying “crack!” and the door swings open, the doorknob slightly bent in the process.<br><br>
<<else>>You knock, eagerly anticipating a response… but there is none. You insist, knocking faster and harder. A muffled response comes.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hold your horses - I’m in the middle of something!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You hear quick steps approaching, the lock opening, and then more steps running away.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"If it’s another delivery, just leave it inside and close the door!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You shrug, confused, and make your way inside.<br><br>
<</if>>
You enter the messy apartment, which seems even more littered with dirty plates and other leftovers than usual. You hear some whirring noises coming from Kris’s bedroom. She shouts:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"KINDA BUSY RIGHT NOW - JUST LEAVE THE STUFF THERE AND CLOSE THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT, ALRIGHT?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Feeling cheeky, you start undressing to your underwear, admiring your gains on Kris’s serendipitous large mirror: <<if $height >= 250>>Your gigantic height makes you feel downright out of scale with your surrounding.<<elseif $height >= 210>>Your towering height gives you a strange electric high, with the awareness that you went from below average to top percentile in such a short time.<<elseif $height >= 175>>You delight in your new heightened stature, your days as “the short girl” a thing of the past.<</if>> <<if $muscle >= 75>>The absurd amount of muscle you now pack glares right back at you, as even relaxed, you look like you might just be able to bench press an automobile, making both your lips and genitals moisten as you fantasize about doing just that. <<elseif $muscle >= 50>>The seminude sexy bodybuilder who looks back at you tantalizes your senses as you playfully bounce your pecs, delighting on the unbridled strength you realize you have at your command. <<elseif $muscle >= 35>>You find yourself sneaking a sampling of flexes, even letting an unexpected gasp as you realize how buff you’re becoming… and that’s just the beginning…<</if>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, baby… surpriiiiiiise!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You hear the whirring subside in instants, as something drops with a thud. After some scuffling, Kris comes out of her room, crawling on the floor hastily. You can see in her eyes that she likes what she sees…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Ooooh, you naughty girl, that’s my kind of surprise, alright!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>You take a few very decisive steps towards her, looking from above, as you see her melting with desire as she literally idolizes you from the ground, a true goddess before her.
<<else>>You walk towards her, and she just eats you up from the ground, basking on the enormous woman before her, wriggling like a worm.
<</if>>
<br><br>
You kneel, and she reaches with her grabby digits, eager to worship you. With surprising care, you grab her by the neck and armpit, lifting her clear off the ground. Her breathing is labored due to the partially constricted windpipe, but you can feel from her raising hair how turned on Kris is getting as her face blushes wildly - and her clear incapacity to stop feeling the ridges of your defined forearms. As you put her down, her anxiety seems to multiply exponentially, clearly struggling to decide whether she would rather undress or keep groping you.<br><br>
<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>Without hesitation, you just place your hands on her collar, and rip her oversized band T-shirt clean in half with a swift motion. It sends chills down her spine - and without even looking, you toss both halves to the side… except, in your attempt to look cool, you end up hitting a table lamp, which falls to the ground and shatters with a loud crash - hundreds of pieces of ceramic spreading everywhere on the already messy floor.<br><br>
<<else>>
You motion for her to remove her oversized band T-shirt, which she does so fast that it seems like she almost phased out of it. But as Kris tosses it to the side, it ends up hitting a table lamp, which falls to the ground and shatters with a loud crash - hundreds of pieces of ceramic spreading everywhere on the already messy floor.<br><br>
<</if>>
You hesitate for a moment, but Kris quickly gets back to her dismissive pattern:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Fuck that lampshade. Actually, fuck me, but just don’t worry about it!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You proceed to plant a passionate kiss on her lips, the now darker room feeling even more romantic as you can now only see a general outline of each other from the light coming from her bedroom. You start pushing Kris towards the wall, with the intent of ravaging her, but while your resilient feet seem mostly unaffected by the ceramic shrapnel from the lamp, you notice Kris wincing as her bare feet step over the debris - bringing her a mix of pain and pleasure that keep you from stopping.<br><br>
However, Kris seems to once again have gone a bit too far: she slips and falls, her feet actively bleeding from the cuts and making the floor dangerously slick.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"FUCK!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Concerned, you stop and turn on the room’s main light, and see the trail of blood. Kris is mostly unfazed, but you are now getting concerned while she still seems to be intent on fucking you.<br><br>
She crawls and attaches herself to your torso, as the ground starts trembling.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random Woman">>"CAN YOU STOP WITH ALL THE NOISE? DO YOU HAVE A ZOO UPSTAIRS OR SOMETHING?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You hear the downstairs neighbors shouting, presumably hitting their ceiling in protest over the racket you are doing.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"FUCK YOU! I DON’T CARE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris demands to be carried to the bedroom, and while you are still somewhat in shock with the whole thing, you find yourself unable not to comply. The ceramic chunks crumble beneath your powerful feet, and you carefully avoid the puddle of blood, still worried as you wonder if Kris is injured, but at least she doesn’t seem to be actively bleeding anymore.<br><br>
As you make your way to the room, you realize what she’d been working on - on top of her other little fetish ventures, you find what she was up to: attaching an enormous fist-sized motorized dildo to the wall with screws. The electric screwdriver is still on the ground near where she must have dropped it when you announced yourself. She looks at it, and then into your eyes, her pupils glistening with childish delight and a hungry sexual appetite.<br><br>
You put Kris down, and she wobbles on her hurt feet, plugging her new toy to the outlet, and eagerly throws the switch…<br><br>
Which immediately causes a fuse to fail, and make the whole room go dark, the only light coming from the external lights from the window.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"HOLY SHIT! WHAT THE FUCK! I JUST WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris’s demeanor changes abruptly, and she becomes unrecognizable as she starts punching and kicking the device on the wall, filled with rage. You’ve never witnessed this side of her, as she violently attacks the motorized pump with reckless abandon - and you become increasingly concerned that she is just going to hurt herself.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"CUNT! SHIT, FUCK! GODDAMN! YOU PRICK!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

Her smile confirms that she knows EXACTLY what you mean. So do her hands, which are not actively caressing your arm and leg in the least discreet way possible. You steel yourself, and just say what you came to say:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, I’d like to keep going out, but I do think we should lay out some things. For one, I’d like to be able to show up at your house after work hours for… fun times, if you don’t mind."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Safe word? Pffffft. Girl, I don’t think you could reach my limits if you TRIED!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            <<else>>but not really enough to make a real impact. You grit your teeth and pump them as much as you can, but you end up having to roll your sleeves so they can see anything. Still, the chat acts super-nice and encouraging, and it inspires you.

            You relax on your chair, but now <b class="KrisMessage">SizeLuvrxxx69xxx</b> has already gotten the crowd to chant “ABS NEXT!”. There’s a wall of the message on the chat. Oh, well, guess you aren’t quite done yet!<br><br>

You run your fingers between the crevices, and the crowd just goes nuts!
            <<elseif $muscle >45>>Your nice abs make themselves noticed, small bumps poking through the fabric. It’s enough to drive people crazy, wondering just how nice your midriff looks under the clothing.
            <<elseif $muscle >30>>You already have a hint of abs, but not quite enough to make an impression under your clothes. So you just raise your top very briefly to give everyone a peek for a split second, and the chat explodes!
            <<else>>You don’t quite have abs yet, so you just raise your shirt for people to see your midriff. <<if $fat >30>>It makes you realize you could lose some weight before really getting people riled up, but it’s what’s there right now.<<else>>it’s a flat stomach, holding the promise of one day housing a proper six-pak - but for now, the chat will just have to wait for you to catch up - and they are very nice about it.<</if>>

            And as if on cue, the chime of donations starts popping even faster. Everyone is contributing with varying amounts - included that promise hundred bucks! By the time you tally it all up, you’ve made a sweet $2000!<br><br><<set $money += 2000>>
            But as you thank everyone, one message stands out.<br><br>

            You look at the camera with an apologetic expression, and shrug as you explain yourself:<br><br>

            The chat is not happy with that. A few people get rather rude, and the volunteer moderators quickly step in. Chaos! But as things start to get out of control, you notice one message:<br><br>

            As the confusion ensues, that message sticks in your head. You try to calm people down, with little success. This little maneuver costs your channel a few subs, but at least you kept your dignity and got no strikes, right?

        content: `Feeling a bit uneasy from Kris and her last break-in, you decide that it’s time to beef up security for your apartment. Thankfully, there was a deadbolt that you found left in the closet, and Johan was nice enough to get you a nice modern biometric lock that works with fingerprints he had around. Given her obsessive nature, it doesn’t make three separate locks feel like overkill.<br><br>
The first deadbolt is a simple task - just something you can screw directly on the door and wall - <<if $muscle > 80>>which you need to do with your fingers, because you accidentally broke the screwdriver with your colossal strength… oops!<<elseif $muscle > 50>>and given your crazy strength, you might have been able to just twist the screws in with your fingers, but you humble yourself to use the screwdriver. Still, the concrete wall gives in like butter.<<elseif $muscle > 30>>thankfully the building has some tools the tenants can borrow, and the power drill comes in hand for fastening the deadbolt to the concrete wall - still, your newfound strength helps a ton as well.<<else>>Despite borrowing the building’s power drill, your middling strength makes the task of fastening the deadbolt to the concrete wall a hard chore, and you are a sweaty mess by the time you are done.<</if>><br><br>
Phew! Alright, the deadbolt is in. Next, the fingerprint lock... you manage to get the device placed on the door, but you realize you have zero idea how to program it. Johan probably has a manual or something? I guess it’s time to hit him up.<br><br>
You head to his apartment, unaware of the silhouette peeping at you from the corridor as you go up the stairs…<br><br>
You chat with Johan briefly, and the lil’ motormouth can’t help but recount the story of how he came across the lock, a hand-me-down from one of the members of the AV Club, but he realized he never was one to lock his door anyway as he is a firm believer in a open-door policy. But eventually you manage to wrestle the manual from him, which he sends as an electronic document to your phone. Nice, with this, you should be able to program the lock!<br><br>
Except, when you get back to your apartment… the door is locked - and the fingerprint device is engaged, somehow? What the what?!?<br><br>
You reach for your key, and hear the expected click. Then, on a whim, you put your thumb on the biometric device - and it blinks green and makes a loud whizzing sound, unlocking the door. Huh? You open the door, but it stops in its tracks by the door chain, which only allows you to peer into the apartment.<br><br>
...<br><br>
You don’t have a door chain. Or, at least, you didn’t when you left to go to Johan’s. You try to squeeze your hand in to open it, but it’s out of reach.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Need some help?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You turn around scared, slamming the door closed in the process, only to find a certain smirking barista lurking in the shadows of the corridor.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Here, let the grown-ups (heh!) handle this..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She motions you out of way forcefully... <br><br>

            You step back, and Kris opens the main lock with a pin (what?) and then uses her own thumb to open the digital lock (WHAT?), before easily reaching inside and undoing the chain like it was nothing! She swings the door open in a matter of seconds with the smuggest expression you’ve ever seen, and walks inside before plopping herself comfortably on your recliner.<br><br>
            It takes you a minute to properly process everything.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wait, did you program the fingerprint lock while I was away for like 5 minutes? And you installed a chain lock... that you can easily open? Wait... AND YOU REGISTERED MY OWN FINGERPRINT?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Kris blows a dismissive raspberry as she waves, suggesting that it was child’s play. You just bring your palm to your face as you realize the main reason you upgraded your security might just be a moot case after all.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hey, I gotta protect my assets, you know? Don’t want just anyone having access to these <humph!> goods."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She bites her lips as she looks at your behind, eating you with her eyes.<br><br>
            You throw your hands up in the air, frustrated. Kris, once again, reveals herself to be the unstoppable force of nature you always knew she was.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why do I even bother?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"<<if $muscle >45 || $height >190>>Not that a BIG GIRL like yourself couldn’t take care of any intruders.

Why, I already corrected most safety flaws, so not just anyone will be getting in your apartment.<</if>>"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Rolling your eyes, you sort of accept that your apartment just may never be completely Kris-free.

            You stand your ground, however, 
            <<if $muscle >75>>making a point of staying completely unmovable as she tries to shove you aside to reach the door. You didn’t expect her to be TURNED ON by that, but it’s a side-effect you’ll have to live with. Never breaking eye contact with her, with your best judgemental face, you just yank the whole door clean off its hinges. Kris shivers, her hands over her nether region over your display of strength and dominance, falling to the floor, presumably quite moistened.<br><br>

You didn’t expect her to be TURNED ON by that, but it’s a side-effect you’ll have to live with. Keeping her at arm’s length, you open both external locks and then just yank the door and break the steel chain clean off. Kris shivers, mouth gaping and steaming over your display of strength.<br><br>
            <<elseif $muscle <35 || $height >185>>you glare from your taller stature, making her stop cold. Without breaking eye contact, with your best judgemental face, you reopen both external locks, then use your lengthy limbs and extraordinary limber joints to reach the chain latch. It’s tricky and takes a while, but you aren’t about to let Kris have this victory. Well, except for the fact she looks extremely turned on by the little display you just put out.
            <<else>>
            with a sigh, you realize you don’t have many options. You tell her to stand still while you go around to squeeze in through the rather cramped ground window. You make your way out of the building and lay down on the ground, trying to squish your torso through the only viable aperture. But as your eyes adapt to the darker environment, you spot Kris eating some popcorn on your recliner. Of course.<br><br>
            You fall down on the ground with a thump, and Kris seems to have very much enjoyed the little show you put for her. As you clean yourself, she offers you a handful of popcorn.  
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of fun today, but now I’d like some privacy, so... out you go."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Ain’t you gonna say please?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She bats her eyes repeatedly, trying to look cute. But you are done with this Krisfestation, and just grab her by the collar and put her in the hallway, hoping it will be the last time you see her today. Not holding your breath on that one, however.

            You try to stop Kris by putting your hands up, but she deftly dodges your attempt with a masterful feint, and with some swift movements she just opens both external locks, undoes the chain latch from outside, and pops the door open, before motioning you in like some sort of punk British butler.<br><br>
            You sigh and roll your eyes. There’s no stopping this Krisfestation, is there? You walk in, defeated, as she closes the door from outside. At least she had the decency of giving you some privacy right now. And so you fall backwards onto your favorite recliner, trying to find solace that at least you got the new locks in.<br><br>
            Until out of nowhere, Kris plops a bowl of popcorn on your lap, explaining with her mouth still full, that she left a spare emergency key under your pillow. Yeah, might as well give up on this one.

        content: `You call Kris, wondering if you can stop by - and she’s more excited than usual. She urges you to come (“No, RUN!”) to her apartment, and you oblige.<br><br>
You rush up the stairs, <<if $shyConfident > 1>>excited with what Kris has in stock - you’ve learned to tell when she’s got some new scheme under her sleeve, and from her voice you are positive she’s got PLANS. You grin as you climb up the stairs, anxious to knock at the door of the apartment.<<else>>somewhat apprehensive about what the devilish imp has cooking - her voice was thick with that mischievous tone you can now tell with ease: she’s scheming, and you are pretty sure she has some naughty preparations just waiting for you. You grip the railing tightly as you hesitantly go up the stairs, taking a deep breath before you approach her apartment door.<</if>> As you knock, the door just moves open, apparently just waiting slightly ajar for you.<br><br>
You walk in, calling for Kris, but hear no response. However, you do spot a handwritten note that simply says “Wear this”, on top of a brightly colored spandex outfit. You close the door, and rolling your eyes, strip down and comply with the instruction.<br><br>
<<if $muscle>=50>>It’s a good thing this is really stretchy material, which seems to barely contain your unnaturally large physique - the costume clings tightly to your sizeable muscles, leaving every bit of definition and every last vein on your arms  and upper chest clearly visible, while the microskirt does little to cover your titanic legs.<<elseif $muscle>=40>>You are surprised at how well this costume fits your rather unusual physique, assuming not many bodybuilder-sized female elastane outfits must be produced. But you can’t dispute the results: your incredible physique makes the costume look almost painted on your torso and arms, while the microskirt couldn’t be any more revealing of your defined legs.<<else>>You feel like Kris secretly took your measurements at some point, because this outfit seems perfectly form-fitting, contouring your body perfectly and making you seem like a real-life comic book character.<</if>> <<if $breasts>=70>>You are also surprised with whatever magic this costume seems to have employed to so perfectly accommodate AND support your titanic breasts, though at the cost of vastly deforming the flashy logo over your chest.<<elseif $breasts>=45>>There’s also some impressive work in offering some sort of built-in support for your sizeable breasts, contouring and supporting them in a way that seems almost impossible - yet, there they are, stretching the flashy logo over your chest.<<elseif $breasts>=25>>The costume snuggly pushes your breasts up, like some sort of amazing bra, bringing more attention to the flashy logo.<<elseif $breasts<25 && $muscle>45>>Despite not having big boobs, your muscular pecs offer a steel-hard shelf that accentuates the flashy logo of the costume quite nicely - and you make them bounce as you amuse yourself.<</if>> <<if $height >=210>>Truth be told, the skirt seems like less than a belt given your absurdly long legs, and the thigh-high boots just reinforce your incredible stature - and even enhance it, with a small heel.<<elseif $height >=180>>The microskirt seems even shorter given your long legs, also reinforced by the thigh-high boots, which also sport small heels that make you even taller.<<else>><</if>> <<if $dick>10>>Your hanging member shames the rather short skirt, making itself known quite clearly… and rather provocatively.<<elseif $dick <=9 && $dick >5>>Though the rather short skirt can barely cover your newfound member, you find the freedom of letting it hang there quite exhilarating.<</if>> But the fact is, as you finish donning the costume, you are unable to resist smiling as you start getting into character, feeling rather like a superheroine.<br><br>
But your introspective moment is rather short lived, as Kris shouts in panic from the next room, which you rush to as your heart accelerates. You come in to find Kris handcuffed to her bed by her wrists, her ankles tied with rope to the bed’s feet, wearing just a skimpy night dress. She looks at you, scared - or pretending to be.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oh, no! I’ve been attacked by robbers, they left me here tied to the bed, you must free me, my hero!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You chuckle, licking your lips at her rather revealing attire. You reach under her dress, but without breaking character, she pleads:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Please! We don’t know when the ruffian might come back! You must free me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You roll your eyes, amused at her commitment to the bit, and you go to untie the rope. However, as you probably should have expected, Kris must be some kind of knot savant - whatever magic she worked on that rope, you know there’s no way in hell you are going to untie.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hurry, he could be here any second!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Oh, so she wants to play it this way? You stand in your best hero pose, hands on your hips, and really ham it up as you proclaim:<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Fear not, citizen, for the SuperLady will free you posthaste!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
That seems to really do it for her, as she squirms and bites her lips, slightly breaking character. <<if $muscle>=80>>Going all in, you reach under the wrought iron bed, which must be incredibly heavy… and just lift the whole shebang off the ground, Kris, rope and all! Her breathing stops, legitimately surprised at your absurd strength, as you start pulling the rope, stretching her leg with some force. The tension seems to slightly hurt, but that somehow makes her even redder in the face, panting as her eyes roll back in sheer pleasure. You carefully pull the rope away, freeing her legs, before putting the bed back down.<<elseif $muscle>=60>>You take a deep breath, and look at the wrought iron leg, and then proceed to apply pressure. Kris lets out a small laugh, excited at you playing along - but as the metal starts bending beneath your fingers, she freezes and turns bright red, before she starts panting. Her eyes bug out as you bend the leg, pulling the rope off, and then just to flex, you bend it back, before proceeding to repeat the feat on the other side. This time, your muscles are already pumped, veins popping out under the spandex, and you position yourself to give Kris the best show possible, before finishing to release her other leg.<<elseif $muscle>=45>>You grab the rope from both ends, and Kris tries to tell you how strong that braided cord is, but you just look at her with a confident smile, and tug at it from both sides - and somehow the rope starts ripping apart under your powerful fingers, freeing her. You walk like a model on a catwalk, licking the tip of your finger as you reach the other side, and repeat the amazing feat.<<else>>Unsure how to proceed, you attempt to untie the rope unsuccessfully, and eventually notice that she’s making exaggerated eyes contact with the table next to you, where she apparently left a blade. You cut the two ropes, freeing her legs, and she smiles.<</if>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oh, thank you, now, the handcuffs, please!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You move next to her, and she moves her leg to seductively rub your side with her feet, which makes you quite hot inside. You look around for keys, and Kris immediately interjects.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oh, no, the villain must have put it in that chest, which has several heavy weight plates on top of it!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Yeah, she’s definitely isn’t going to make this easy. But that’s not going to deter you. <<if $muscle>=80>>You look at what you assume to be close to <<weightConversion 200>> on top of the chest, which you could probably lift rather easily, so you decide to just lean heavily on the theatrics… and just snap the handcuff chain with your fingers! Kris clearly had no idea you could do that, as her eyes bug out. <<elseif $muscle>=60>>You provocatively strut towards the chest, and with one arm, lift what is probably twice her weight in plates, making Kris literally salivate. You open the chest and grab the key, and resist the temptation to just leave her cuffed there… but you unlock one wrist, and she tries to jump on top of you, but she just gets restrained by the other handcuff.
<<elseif $muscle>=40>>With some difficulty, you lift the entire stack of plates, but you try very hard to make it seem like they are weightless - and to be fair, it makes you feel kinda super as you get into the illusion, imagining that it’s actually THOUSANDS instead of a hundreds of <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>kilos<<else>>pounds<</if>>. But now the chest is accessible, and you acquire the key, which allows you undo one of the handcuff, and Kris’s hand immediately shoots to your now-pumped upper arm. But you are not done.
<<else>>You walk to the plates, and try to make the process of removing plate by plate look as effortless as you can to maintain the illusion. You eventually reach the bottom, opening it and going for the key, which allows you to open one handcuff. Your lover’s eyebrows raise as she seems to invite you to join her.
<</if>>With one wrist still stuck, she just tugs towards you, stretching as her lips try to reach yours. You stand back, with a naughty smile, performing a side chest flex while she can’t touch you. Huh, you could get used to this, maybe you ought to look more into bondage after all…<br><br>
You repeat the process with the other handcuff, and Kris kneels on the bed, before proceeding.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"My hero! You saved my life! Oh, what could I do to thank you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
She blinks, absolutely committed to the damsel in distress roleplay, which makes her seem almost like a different person… but you’d be lying if you said you weren’t completely moist by now.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do not worry, for I was given these powers to do good, and it is my duty! No need for rewards!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Kris leans back, seductively rubbing her legs and looking at you hungrily. Despite the cognitive dissonance of her putting on this innocent persona, her eye betray how she wants to just ravage you. With a smirk, she gets up from the other side of the bed, and reveals her plan as she walks towards the chest.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I suppose I will have to search my stash and get what could possibly be your only weakness, I have this giant radioactive-green dildo that might just be your krypto..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
But before she can complete her joke, time freezes as a sequence of events that will forever be ingrained in your brain unfolds.<br><br>
As she walks, looking distractedly at you, Kris accidentally steps on the rope that is still tied to her ankles, and spins and stumbles, tripping over the weight plates that were moved to the ground. She hits her hips against the windowsill, and her wrist lands awkwardly over the ashtray she left there, making her arm slip… and she falls headfirst out of the 5th floor window.<br><br>

As you pass by a sporting goods store, you notice that it is one of the places where cops are checking, talking to the owner in front of it. You get the feeling that these events are somehow connected. And like clockwork, your phone start chiming.<br><br>
As you check your messages, you see Kris and her usual rambling, begging for you to meet her back at your apartment. All you can do is hope that she didn’t bring all that heat back with her. And so you make your way back home.<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, you find your own door wide open, and hear a maniacal laughter as you approach it. And while you feel yourself already dreading before you even cross the threshold, you are still surprised as you find your apartment COVERED in her loot.<br><br>
Wow! So it seems like Kris has been busy - you need to sidestep bottles and more bottles of the unusual concoctions you’ve become so used to all over the floor, reaching an inordinate amount of exercise equipment. It’s everything from jumping rope, exercise bands, weights of all kinds and sizes... you name it, it is there. And that’s not all, dozens and dozens of huge bottles of supplements seem to be stacked over towards your bedroom. Kris herself is laying down, in her best sexy pose, leaning her head against her arm, one leg bent over the other. She looks excitedly at you, eyes eager for your reaction for the treasure trove of growth supplies she has acquired - and frankly, you need a second to process all of that. She really did go all out, and as you take stock - geez, if you put all this to use, you can barely comprehend just how GIGANTIC you could become!<br><br>

		<<replace "#choice">>
            Blinking, you try to articulate your feelings, but you can only sigh and scoff, as you try to not freak out completely and just not shout at her.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris, aside the fact that there seems to be a FUCKING MANHUNT for you in town right now, can we, FOR ONCE, just keep this being about US, and not your crazy sexual impulses? Can you see me for who I am for a second?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Kris freezes in shock, as you realize you failed to keep it cool and went a lot more aggressively than you expected. She bites her lips, frowning, and you feel bad for coming in so hot.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Listen, Kris, I’m honored that you went through all this trouble - well, I mean, I appreciate the effort, but it worries me that your behavior can get so self-destructive, and all for what?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Kris babbles some incoherent noises, looking around at everything she has gotten for you, utterly shocked at your reaction.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Not only I don’t want you getting in trouble, but do you realize that it makes me feel a bit inadequate? Like I’m not good enough for you unless I’m huge? Do you understand how that makes me feel?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You speak from your heart, and it certainly affects Kris more than you’ve ever experienced before, as her shock transfigures into an expression of sadness. She pouts and lets out a lone sob, before whispering:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I-I’m sorry, <<print $playerFirstName>>, I don’t care if you are huge or small. I mean, it’s fun and exciting, but I’d still want to be with you... no matter what."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            And in an unbelievable moment of self-reflection (and possibly, GASP, shame?!?), Kris avoids your eyes. You feel genuinely bad for chewing her out. You realize, sure, she was doing it for herself to a point... but she was also doing it for you.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, how about we return this stuff, say we found it in an alley? We can put it all behind the building and I’ll let them know that it just appeared here."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Kris smiles softly, nodding.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Yeah, of course. Though... the supplements I actually bought. You can keep those."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris, how much did you spend on those? I can’t imagine you are making that much money at the café..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Nah, no worries. I did dig some into my groceries budget, but I got enough canned soup to last me the rest of the month."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            It’s your turn to sigh, as you roll your eyes.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess I’m just going to have to work out extra hard to make sure I get as much from all that as I can..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Promise?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Are you kidding me? Just carrying all this stuff back there is probably going to be the biggest workout I get this week. Just how the hell did you bring all of this here so fast?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"A magician never reveals her tricks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You start stacking as much of the material as you can, and you watch Kris trying to do the same. You can’t even get that mad at her, you realize. But maybe now she’ll settle down a bit and not get herself in as much trouble. You can only hope...

	<<link "Damn, girl, you won’t rest until I’m the biggest there ever was? Challenge accepted!">>
		<<replace "#choice">>
            You start to slightly salivate at the prospect of what this treasure trove could do to you, and biting your lips, you admit:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Fuck, Kris, with this much stuff, I am not even sure I can imagine how big and strong I could get..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"That’s why I’m here to find out, together with you. I wasn’t planning to stop until you are the biggest, baddest, strong bitch in the planet."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You start grabbing the bottles, piling them up until you cannot stack them safely anymore in your arms.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"This is... whoa. With this I could..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Become a giant muscular goddess? I’m betting on it, babe. Even if I have to whip you into shape! I actually got a whip somewhere in here!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Aren’t you afraid of what I could do to you if I get that buff?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Afraid? Girl, I am not resting until you are using houses as stools and juggling school buses. I don’t think you get my commitment here."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You laugh at her fantasy, obviously that’s impossible... right?<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"So, what are you waiting for?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<if $carefreeCarefull < -1 && $submissiveDominant > 1>>
            You mischievously reach for the heaviest pair of dumbbells you find in the mess, and bend down to pick them up, facing away from Kris.<br><br>
            You start very slowly executing some dumbbell deadlifts, letting the entranced nympho just watch your glutes and hamstrings in all their glory. You savor each rep, letting out a soft moan which, from the reaction coming from Kris, makes it seem like she’s climaxing right there and then.<br><br> 
            <<else>>
            You watch at the never-ending piles of stuff and feel a bit overwhelmed. That, and you originally had some other plans before your day was taken over by Kris.<br><br>
            <</if>>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Listen, this does sound fun, but even if I wanted, I don’t think all this stuff you bought even fits in my stomach, and I do have other errands to run. That, and now I will have to reorganize my apartment because, huh... you made a bit of a mess."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Oh, no worries there. Here, you go back out, I’ll clean up and see myself out. We should make this a special occasion, you are totally right."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris, I think some of the weights you got me must be like three times heavier than you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"A magician never reveals her tricks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            She says with a wink, and insists that you don’t have to worry.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I mean, until we meet again to have fun with some of this. I’ll be looking forward to a bigger you when we meet next time."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Truth is, so are you. She really went all out... and as you leave, you can’t help but feel like Kris is the weirdest underachiever you’ve ever met. It seems that all she needs is the proper motivation...
