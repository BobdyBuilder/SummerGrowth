        content: `Having nothing better to do, you head over to Johan’s apartment. You find the door standing ajar, curtains closed and lights dimmed. With curiosity taking the better of you, you decide to step in silently, as you hear a very weird roar coming from where you can see a glow.<br><br> You find Johan sitting cross-legged on his sofa, watching a black and white movie of a giant lizard destroying a city full of buildings. He is stuffing his face with popcorn, completely enraptured by the old flick. You start getting some mischievous ideas, and approach the sofa from behind with a grin.<br><br> <<if $carefreeCarefull < -1 && $muscle >= 60>>You carefully kneel behind the sofa, and put your forearms under it carefully. You wait until the monster starts growling and, in a fluid motion, lift the sofa, Johan, popcorn and all, as you attempt a very bad imitation of the monster’s roar. Johan goes white in the face as his glasses fall to the ground, grabbing hard against the sofa before you put the whole thing down with a laugh. <<elseif $carefreeCarefull < -1 && $height >= 165>>You wait until a scary part of the movie, then suddenly insert your arms under Johan’s armpits from behind, giving him a bear hug as you lift him off the sofa. He lets out a scared yelp and tries to shake free, to little avail, as his glasses fall down to the ground.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, chill! It’s just moi!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You gently put him down by your side with a giggle. <<elseif $carefreeCarefull < -1>>You wait until a scary part of the movie, then suddenly wrap your arms around Johan, giving him a tight bear hug. He lets out a scared yelp and tries to shake free, to little avail, as his glasses fall down to the ground.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, chill! It’s just moi!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You let go of him with a laugh. <<else>>You perform an athletic jump over the sofa, falling on the spot next to him. Startled, he gives a jump and drops the popcorn while his glasses fall to the ground.<br><br> <</if>> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"My glasses! I can’t see anything!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He waves his arms confusedly ahead of him, trying to feel for his viewing implements. You go turn on the lights as he continues kneeling and blindly unable to find the glasses.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, It’s okay, let me look for them."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say as you offer a hand to help him up. He grabs your forearm, and is visibly shaken. He gives it a very firm squeeze, his fingers having trouble completely encompassing the meaty appendage.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>? Did… did you bring your boyfriend… or your pet bear with you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You let out a hearty laugh, as you grab and return his glasses to him. As he puts them on, he looks at you in shock, scanning your whole body top to bottom a few times.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>? Is that you? You look… uh… bigger…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<if $shyConfident >= 1 || $carefreeCarefull < -1>>You roll your eyes with fake innocence, and put a finger on your lower lip with a pout as you bring up your other arm in a very impressive flex. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you are talking about these?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You raise your other arm for a double biceps flex, still feigning childish innocence.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess I have been working out some. Did you notice?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<elseif $shyConfident > 1>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, these?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You give Johan a show of your flexed biceps, giving them a pat with your other hand.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ve been working out lately, and I guess I’m getting pretty strong."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<elseif $shyConfident < 0>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I just couldn’t resist."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You apologize while you blush at his comment, putting your arms behind your back.<br><br> <</if>> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Are you kidding me? You look like you could destroy Tokyo by yourself! Just how strong are you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, I’d say plenty. Here, wanna feel?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You offer your flexed biceps to him. Hesitantly, Johan brings his fingers and pokes at the mound that just sprouted on your upper arm. His mouth is agape as the prods it, <<if $fat >= 35>>the velvety skin giving in briefly as he hits the big sinewy mass under it, hard as rubber.<<else>>your hard-as-steel sinew at full display, its incredible definition allowing him to see each muscle as if looking at an anatomy chart. <</if>> After some tentative poking, Johan wraps his hand around as much of your arm as his fingers allow, giving a small squeeze, completely dumbstruck.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, Johan, you can do better than that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan squeezes as hard as he can, his fingertips losing a bit of color as he does - you can barely feel any pressure. <<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>>You grit your teeth and find it in yourself to flex a bit harder, giving your arm an extra pump and forcing Johan’s hand to open a bit wider, smiling proudly at him as you see the color draining from his face as well.<</if>><br><br> Johan gulps audibly. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"But… for real… how strong are you? D-did you test your strength?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You watch as his mind seems to start reeling a bit.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I’ve been hitting the weights some, but I’m not sure what you mean."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, you know. Superheroes have all kinds of power levels. You’d be surprised how much time I spent discussing that on message boards about who is stronger than who, and if they can do this or that."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You really doubt you’d be as surprised as he thinks if you actually found out how much time he spends doing that. In fact, you wouldn’t be surprised at all if he told you he does that every night for hours.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I dunno, when heroes get their powers, sometimes they will do all kinds of tests, like lifting heavy furniture, crushing or bending something… or, you know, the true-and-tried stuff, like doing hard exercises like pull-ups and stuff."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <span id="choice"> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Crushing and bending? That sounds like fun.">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What, are you going to pull a steel bars from your magic hat?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"ACTUALLY…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He runs off without an explanation, making a beeline to the closet. You hear some loud clanging. After a bit, he walks out… well… walking is a bit of an overstatement. He is moving sideways slowly like a crab, with his knees bent, cradling a girthy steel rebar taller than himself.<br><br> As he approaches, you look quizzically before asking:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why the hell do you have a steel rebar?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He drops the heavy piece to the ground with a loud clang, catching his breath before answering. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, I wanted to do this gray wizard cosplay, and all the sticks I found around campus sucked. So I figured I could cover and paint something more solid, and asked my uncle who works in construction for a favor. I seriously think he gave me this as a practical joke, though."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90 && $shyConfident > 2>> With no hesitation, you reach for the bar, lifting it one handedly with ease. Johan’s eyes widen as you smirk at him, putting your second hand on the other edge of the bar, never breaking eye contact with him.<br><br> You start applying force on the rebar, your smirk growing as much as the muscles on your back, arms and chest. You can swear you hear Johan’s heartbeats accelerating as his jaw drops. Your silhouette seems to dwarf him even more as the rebar slowly bends 10… 20 degrees… your smile becomes more confident as you pass the 45 degree mark, making all the way to 90, but still going.<br><br> Johan has stopped breathing, but you are not quite done yet. You keep bending as your hands approach each other, the effort becoming harder and harder. But you are not about to give up. You make that extra little effort and contort the bar so both ends are slightly past each other, creating a loop. You give Johan a wink, before placing the rebar around his neck playfully.<br><br> Except you kinda forgot he wasn’t quite as capable as you, and he almost falls to the ground as you grab it back before he hurts himself, holding him by the arm with your other hand. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I guess I really don’t know my own strength after all…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan is quite impressed with your display of strength, but indecisive whether he wants to question you further about your capabilities… or how to display the little memento you just created for him. He starts, unsurprisingly, going off on all the scenes in which superheroes did that in pop culture, and you watch him excitedly talk about special effects and classic comics… his adorkable charm is surprisingly cute. After a while you realize he doesn’t seem to be getting any closer to a point, and decide to return to your apartment before he comes up with a superhero name and uniform for you. <<elseif $muscle >= 90>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained, I guess…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You grab the bar tentatively, downright surprised at how light it feels. You manage to lift it single-handedly, and try to position yourself so to ease the attempt: holding both ends so you can really engage your back and chest in the attempt.<br><br> You take a deep breath and put all your might in the metal bar with your arms. Both of you are taken aback as the piece starts bending, little by little. Johan starts cheering on you, and you just keep going until you looped it completely.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow… I guess I might just have to start looking at superhero job offers online… or maybe construction."<</Dialogue>><br><br> As you look at Johan, he is giddily jumping from one foot to another, with a big smile and bright eyes. He seems pretty excited about the rebar, citing all instances of popular media in which the character did just that, and how he can use that as prop… apparently having forgotten how hard it was for him to carry it.<br><br> He seems lost in thought as he apparently wonders what exactly he will do with his little memento. As he keeps mumbling to himself, you figure your job is done and it’s time to go home, feeling pretty proud of your accomplishment. <<elseif $muscle >= 55>> You look at the piece of metal taunting you on the floor. It’s almost hypnotizing as you get a mental image of yourself in a superhero suit, the bar malleable in your hands. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That… looks a bit intimidating. But hey, why not give it a try?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You reach down and grab the bar with both hands. It feels solid and with some weight to it, but you can handle it easily enough, quite a contrast from Johan’s attempt to carry it. You tentatively move your hands, figuring the best possible grip. This is going to be quite the challenge, but you aren’t about to give up.<br><br> You start pulling the ends down with incredible effort, your back, chest and arms exploding with an incredible pump - which Johan apparently notices, as his eyes dart over your upper body almost ignoring the bar itself.<br><br> And that proves to be a mistake, because soon the piece of metal starts giving in… just a little bit, but it’s enough to give you a head-start. As it slowly bends, you feel fatigue hitting all major muscle groups, but you are too far in to stop now. Your face reddens as you let out a grunt, and it just keeps going. Johan just watches incredulously, his mind refusing to accept your feat.<br><br> The bar finally reaches a 90 degree bend, and you stop with a deep breath. You look at the bar proudly, and Johan reaches out with his hand, slowly feeling the metallic material from the point where it bent and continuing over its corrugated surface…<br><br> But in his shocked surprise, he just keeps going all the way until your fingers make contact. As you two touch, both feel your hearts skipping a beat. As your eyes meet, his hand absent-mindedly continues over your rigid forearm, incredibly pumped from the effort. He continues, feeling your biceps as he slowly makes his way to your equally engorged shoulders. You can see your warm breath leaving your mouth as visible vapor, both your mouths wide open.<br><br> And then Johan shouts: <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"THAT… WAS INCREDIBLE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are snapped out of your lascivious thoughts, shaking your head and blinking. Johan steps closer to you, as he starts taking imaginary finger measurements of each and every muscle on your body with gusto. He seems lost in thought as he apparently fantasizes about your abilities. Very flustered, you silently just walk out in a hurry, biting your lips as you try not to fantasize yourself about something else. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> You look at the piece of metal taunting you on the floor. It’s almost hypnotizing as you get a mental image of yourself in a superhero suit, the bar malleable in your hands. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… I think this might be going a tad too far?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You confusedly grab both ends of the bar, feeling its considerable weight as you bring it up towards your chest. You try to figure out the best way to go about this, but the task just plain seems impossible. Johan, however, looks at you excitedly, and you’d hate to disappoint the little guy.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m not sure I have much of a chance…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan, however, seems unfazed. He seems to have an epiphany, and brings up a video on his phone of someone bending a bar on their head, by placing a towel between it and the bar. Before you can object, Johan is already handing you a towel.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, it’s the most important item a hitchhiker can carry!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look at him confused, but oblige, and soon you have a similar setup to the person from the video. You can’t help but shake the fact that he looked so much bigger and more defined than you… but… you can’t allow yourself to disappoint Johan without even trying.<br><br> Soon you have the bar above your head, cushioned by the towel. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, pouring 110% of your effort into the task. Your teeth are completely exposed as your face reddens, and every fiber of your muscles bulge. Johan looks at you in awe, as your biceps could pass for one of the heroes from his comics. He starts cheering you on, and it magically feels like… you are getting stronger? You could swear you are growing as your muscles pump, and you get a second wind. Your head hurts, but that pain somehow seems to channel directly into your nerves, making you feel more and more powerful.<br><br> You grit your teeth harder and harder, and they feel like they might just shatter at any second. And yet, you persevere. And put more and more effort as your back and chest seem to be pushed to their very limits. And then past it - and yet, the bar refuses to bend.<br><br> You take a deep breath and let out a guttural shout. Suddenly, the bar just immediately bends 25 degrees before falling to the ground.<br><br> You two watch the bar for a full minute in utter disbelief, until you catch your breath and let out an excited “whoop!” Johan is quick to join in, jumping onto your arms as you spin him around. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Who’s the superhero now?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You are, you are!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You proceed to take a bunch of silly photos, pretending to be hitting Johan on the head with the bar, as if his head was bending it. Many laughs are had, and you eventually decide to go back home. You can’t help but give your flexed biceps a very strong squeeze as you bite your lip and fantasize about how strong you could possibly get. <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I think you might be going a bit crazy, Johan."<</Dialogue>><br><br> But he seems adamant that you try anyway. He even pulls up a video of someone your age doing it… but it’s a guy, and a bodybuilder on top of that. But Johan begs you with his best puppy eyes until you give a resigned sigh and agrees to give it a try.<br><br> You awkwardly put a towel on your head like the guy on the video, and proceed to get the bar… which seems to be as heavy as Johan made it seem - but considerably easier for you to handle than it was for him, given your strength differential.<br><br> Still, we are talking about BENDING STEEL. You place it on top of your head, and with some fear you start exerting pressure against it, unsuccessfully. But you look at Johan, his expectant eyes jumping between the immobile bar and your bulging biceps, and something sparks inside of you. No! This won’t do. And suddenly, you feel a fire growing from your very core. You frown, grit your teeth and just start to put more and more effort into the impossible challenge.<br><br> You can’t tell how much time has passed, but the fire keeps growing, and you just keep giving more and more of yourself. At this point, Johan’s eyes are fixed intently on you, as your whole upper body seems to respond to whatever it is you are invoking.<br><br> You let out a primal scream, and a wave of burning fatigue washes over your entire body. You fall on your knees, dropping the bar. Johan is immediately there to hold your torso, his arms wrapped around you with enormous care. You feel your body cramping pretty bad, and he helps you get up and stretch. He offers to get you a hot towel or an ice pack, but you wave him off saying you are okay.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Ah, I think I have some menthol analgesic rub in the bathroom!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Before you can respond, he’s off. You sit back down, massaging your pained muscles, when you notice something unusual… the tile on the floor has a straight pattern. The bar feel parallel to the tile… and yet, one of the tips is slightly past the division of the tiles?<br><br> Johan rushes back with the tub of medicine, which he haphazardly dabs on his fingers and starts rubbing your tight muscles. He offers you a massage, and you are forced to accept.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Admit it, you offered this medicine just to have an excuse to rub my muscles…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say that in jest, but Johan’s face goes red immediately. You let out a big laugh, and he just looks away as he keeps trying very hard to work out the kinks on your back, his soft hands having a hard time properly massaging your solid posterior.<br><br> Still, after he is done, you go back home, the image of the bar against the tile burned in your mind. You may have to give that another go someday, you think to yourself. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, do you have any steel bars laying around?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say with a laugh, but realize that Johan is looking at you with a mischievous smile. He tells you to wait a moment, and goes into his closet, where you hear some clanging. After a bit, he walks out… well… walking is a bit of an overstatement. He is moving sideways slowly like a crab, with his knees bent, cradling a girthy steel rebar taller than himself.<br><br> As he approaches, you look quizzically before asking:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why the hell do you have a steel rebar?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He drops the heavy piece to the ground with a loud clang, catching his breath before answering. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, I wanted to do this gray wizard cosplay, and all the sticks I found around campus sucked.

It’s… a bit intimidating.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, maybe we should start with something a bit more modest, perhaps?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan looks deflated at your attitude, but understands it. He reaches for the rebar once again, but you push him aside gently. When you grab it, you are very surprised at how light it feels on your hands, but say nothing. You put it back in the closet, and the two of you change the subject… but for the rest of the day, the ease with which you lifted that piece of metal eats at the back of your mind like a parasite… <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> <<link "Lifting heavy stuff is what I was made for!">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I certainly feel quite at home lifting heavy stuff. Did you have something in mind?<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say that cheerfully, but Johan looks at you and gulps again. He stammers a bit as he continues.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, we need a real test. D-do you think… you can lift my refrigerator?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90 && $shyConfident > 2>> You scoff at the idea.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, let’s have at it! Should be child’s play, really.<</Dialogue>><br><br> You announce confidently, as you make your way to his kitchen. You stand in front of the large old appliance, rubbing your hands with excitement. You wrap your large arms around the device with your knees bent… and with a little grunt, lift the entire thing up a foot or two. It’s not easy, but certainly doable. As if to illustrate your point, you bend your knees for squats a few times just to show off before putting it back down.<br><br> Johan stands by your side, completely speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See? Told you so!<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan starts giving little small jumps in place, with the silliest grin ever. He starts spouting superhero stats faster than you can process. You just keep nodding and smiling, thinking that his adorkable charm is surprisingly cute. After a while you realize he doesn’t seem to be getting any closer to a point, and decide to return to your apartment before he comes up with a superhero name and uniform for you. <<elseif $muscle >= 90>> The idea sounds pretty cool, as you imagine yourself like some sort of real-life superhero from one of his comics. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess it doesn’t hurt to try…<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two of you reach the kitchen. You exchange some confused looks, and you take a deep breath as you brace yourself for the herculean task ahead of you. Bending your knees and wrapping your arms around the metal appliance, you close your eyes and… <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"W-wow…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look down sideways and see the little shadow of the fridge on the ground as you straighten your knees. You can’t believe it, but you did it! This is heavy, but surprisingly manageable. You very slowly and carefully set the fridge down, and realize you are not even THAT winded from it.<br><br> Johan steps closer to you, as he starts taking imaginary finger measurements of each and every muscle on your body with gusto. He seems lost in thought as he apparently fantasizes about your abilities.

Could you really lift a fridge? It sounds so improbable…<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"D-do you need anything? A minute?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You shake your head with an expression of pure determination. I mean, other than back injury, what do you really have to lose? You bend your knees and wrap your arms around the appliance, taking a deep breath.<br><br> You put all your might, your entire body shaking as you push yourself to your very limit. Gritting your teeth, you feel every muscle getting pumped, but also very fatigued. You start to regret the idea when suddenly…<br><br> There’s a small rumble, and your knees give a jerk as they raise the refrigerator half a foot off the ground. You let out a small scream as your drop the fridge, making the whole apartment shake enough that you are afraid the floor might collapse.<br><br> The two of you stand there, staring with open mouths at the fridge and each other.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"YOU DID IT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I DID IT!<</Dialogue>><br><br> You two start a rowdy discussion about how cool that was, as the neighbors complain and hit walls. But neither of you care… you two feel like a superhero and her sidekick, and nothing is going to take that away from you right now. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I’m flattered you think so highly of me, Johan, but I think you might be overestimating my strength a bit there.<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan looks at you with puppy eyes and a pout. You know he’ll just start begging if you don’t, so you shrug and, resigned, make your way to the kitchen.<br><br> You stand right next to the refrigerator. Right now, it feels even bigger than you remember. Johan is following right behind you, squealing in anticipation. You take a deep breath and bend your knees, minding your back for the impossible task ahead of you.<br><br> You grit your teeth and grunt, pushing your entire body to its limits. Every muscle burns, and your breathing goes deeper. But you push yourself, harder and harder. You feel like you are crossing limits you didn’t expect to be so high, and you just keep pushing.<br><br> But the nerves eventually subside, as if the whole world freezed around you, no sounds, no feelings - as if the only things in the universe were you and the fridge. Every law of physics is suddenly revoked, just as the mental limitations you impose on yourself. And at that precise moment, you feel your knees lifting <<if $measurementSystem is "imperial">>a quarter of an inch<<else>>half a centimeter<</if>>.<br><br> And then the whole world comes flushing back, and you step back, scared of yourself. You look at your hands, incredulously, as Johan taps you on the back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, at least you tried. Thanks for doing that for me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are left speechless. Johan is already going on another tangent, so you slowly make your way back to your apartment, still transfixed as you stare into your hands, the realization of your potential sinking in with a mix of fear and excitement. <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, this is a job for MuscleGirl!<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two of you joke as you go to the kitchen, and you play comically as you try with all your strength to move the monolithic appliance.<br><br> Johan cheers on you for a whole minute, half-jokingly and half-seriously, as your face reddens at the futile task. You try as hard as you can until you are out of breath, but the fridge does not budge a single iota. You eventually break into laughter, soon to be joined by Johan as you slip down your knees to the floor.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess MuscleGirl’s weakness is fridgetonyte!<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan also falls down to the ground with laughter, as the two of you slap each other’s backs. Once you catch your breath, he starts telling you stories of feats of strength from his comic books, which you listen to with due amusement.<br><br> After a while, you decide to head back home. But a little something on the back of your head still nibbles at you, daydreaming about someday being able to do those feats of strength Johan so excitedly talked about. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> <<link "Exercises? Pick your poison!">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"With pleasure!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Soon, Johan starts listing a ton of famous scenes and montages of superheroes training, and you have a hard time keeping concentrated as he goes on every tangent possible and imaginable. <<if $skills[0].level > 2>>You are immediately familiar with every exercise he mentions, and getting a bit bored - none of them seem like a worthy challenge. <<else>>While you don’t recognize every exercise he brings up, none of them seem to have the appeal to entice you. <</if>> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>“... and he actually did the salmon ladder himself for the show!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Suddenly, your eyes gleam.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What was that just now?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"The Purple Arrow? He’s so cool, though I will admit he had that awkward phase in the comics when they paired him with the Purple Lantern, it was a bit cringe…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, no… what you said he did himself for the show?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>“... Oh, the salmon ladder? It was such an iconic scene, I swear they keep bringing it up so much it’s gotten kind of played out… but still, you can’t deny it’s cool seeing him bring the bar up the rungs."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You find yourself licking your lips, almost salivating at the idea of trying the salmon ladder - you’ve seen people doing in that ninja competition show: holding a bar that catches on latches on both sides, with more and more latches all the way up, forcing you to use your momentum to thrust yourself up, and catch the bar on the next set of latches. It looks extremely challenging physically… But… where would you find one, you mumble to yourself.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Kinda crazy to imagine that the previous tenant here actually built one on the roof, can’t imagine the last time it got used…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Before he can continue, you are dragging him by his sleeve, on your way to the roof.<br><br> The roof is a bit of a mess. There’s pigeon crap everywhere, and a bunch of broken or forgotten equipment. But as promised, there’s a fully working, if a bit hastily assembled, salmon ladder; its bar laying on the floor, forgotten… but not for long.<br><br> Johan is still going on about the scene as you crack your fingers and grab the bar. It isn’t until you actually set the bar up and latch it to the first rung that he snaps out of it.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh… <<print $playerFirstName>>?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Now it’s your turn to forget the world around you: you are 100% focused. There is nothing except for you, the bar you are holding, and that series of latches that go up to the heavens. GAME ON!<br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90>> You brace yourself, doing some perfect-form pull-ups to warm yourself up. Confident, you take a deep breath, and do a quick pull-up while lifting your knees to gain momentum… then it’s like everything is in slow motion as you propel your incredible mass up, and stretch your arms to get the bar caught in the latches of the next rung. Your heartrate shoots up as bar stabilizes itself, and you give an exhilarated laugh! You got this!<br><br> You repeat the process in another tentative step, still cautiously getting the hang of the movement, and again, you climb another rung without issue. At this point, your heart is just racing with the sheer excitement of your own prowess! But you aren’t stopping there. You manage another two rungs the same way… and now you feel completely confident. You just keep propelling yourself up, and it feels like flying. You stop looking at the rungs, just basking in the aerial view of the campus… soaring like a bird. You just keep going up and up and up and up and…<br><br> By the time you notice, you’ve reached the next to last rung. For the first time, you look down, where you see Johan. Wow, whoever built this metal structure… this feels way taller than it should be, with the structure improvised from the scaffolding of a concert stage. You don’t think Johan could even reach your feet if he jumped and stretched his arm. But the adrenaline has taken over, and you feel completely unstoppable. So you warn Johan to step away.<br><br> With complete conviction, you finish the last rung of the ladder, and grin. You propel yourself forward with a small swing, and pull the bar back, unlatching it from the device. You drop it to the side, as you brace yourself…<br><br> With grace, your let your feet take the brunt of the landing impact, bringing one knee and one hand down in a textbook superhero landing. The floor cracks beneath you as it trembles, and Johan loses his balance and falls on his butt behind you. You feel completely invincible.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That… was… UNBELIEVABLE! How did you learn to do that? Can you do it again? I should have recorded it on my phone. It’s just like in the movie where the guy figures out he’s a superhero! And… "<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan just babbles on and on. But you are in another dimension right now. This experience was a revelation, and you start planning about coming here to work out again…<br><br> And then the whole structure starts shaking, and the salmon ladder rumbles and falls apart. I guess it just wasn’t quite ready to handle your mass.<br><br> Johan might be so excited he doesn’t even notice. Not that it matters. You feel like a billion bucks, and decide to go back to your apartment for a much deserved shower. You just hope Johan remembers to go back inside before tomorrow. <<elseif $muscle >= 50>> You assume this is probably harder than it looks. And it looks pretty damn hard as it is. You do a tentative pull up to warm yourself up, getting a feeling for the motion. The cold breeze gives you a shiver, but you are not about to get discouraged.<br><br> You take a deep breath, and jerk yourself up and raise the bar. It barely makes it to the next rung, giving you quite a scare… which is immediately replaced by absolute bliss. You take another deep breath, concentrate… and BOOM! You just managed to do another rung. Suddenly, it dawns on you that you might just make it.<br><br> But then you look up. The makeshift salmon ladder, assembled from welded stage scaffolding, is ridiculously high. You are not so sure you can get so high… but you are still determined to try.<br><br> Again, bracing before each step, you manage to make another two rungs. Your heart rate seems to increase with each success. You look around, getting a magnificent view of the campus from up here. This is so exciting! So you try another rung…<br><br> And the bar latches on one side, but not the other! You try to brace yourself on the scaffolding, but the metal starts creaking and the whole piece starts breaking apart. You manage to slow your descent, but you still fall awkwardly on your ass. Johan, stunned, tries to pull you back, but he can’t budge you <<if $measurementSystem is "imperial">>an inch<<else>>a centimeter<</if>>. You raise your arms and protect both of you from the lose metal pieces - which thankfully are hollow and fairly light, all things considered. Once the chaos is over, Johan is just looking at you, completely flabbergasted.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Did… did you just save me from falling debris? "<</Dialogue>><br><br> His eyes beam with adoration. True, you are pretty sure that, even if those pieces had hit him directly on the head, he would probably get a nasty bump at worst. Still, he is so excited from the experience, it would seem like he actually believes you just saved his life. He gives you a tight hug, and you hug him back.<br><br> Damn, he is such a good hugger. His arms feel good and warm around you, and you kind of wish time would just stop. But it doesn’t, and soon both of you decide there’s not much else to do on the now even messier roof.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Wait until I tell my friends on the message boards what I’ve been through! I’m going to be FAMOUS!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You kind of doubt that, but that doesn’t keep Johan’s enthusiasm from being downright contagious. You head back to your apartment, feeling amazing, even if you didn’t make it all the way up. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> As you look up the ladder, your enthusiasm feels a lot colder: boy, is this weird metal scaffolding TALL! You can’t even have a good idea of how many rungs there are! But you are not about to back down, nuh-huh.<br><br> You try to get a feel for this, doing a pull-up. You know you can manage a few, but this is like next-level compared to that. Still, you swing a couple of times, still trying to understand the physics of it all. You can only procrastinate so much, though… so you kind of just swing up and do it, without thinking!<br><br> Before you know, you realize you made it! You managed to go up one rung! Your heart is racing, your mouth feels a bit dry. This is all insane! Before you know it, you try again, but this time you mess up, losing your balance and getting the bar stuck on the scaffolding. The whole structure shakes as you fall on your butt.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>! You okay?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You see concern on Johan’s face. This was just a bit of a tumble, but the little guy is legit worried about you, it’s kind of endearing. You smile at him and say: <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, I’m fine. It’s just my pride that is hurt! Haha!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Still, he helps you up, examining you to make sure you are alright. You try to reassure him it was nothing. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really, don’t worry. I guess I just need some practice. Maybe we’ll try again another day."<</Dialogue>><br><br> As you make your way back to the stairs, the whole device finally gives its final creak and falls apart. Dang! I guess you’ll have to find another place to try that. <<else>> OK, this was definitely a bad idea. You remember that pull-ups are already not your forte, and your experimentation on the bar reveals that your chances are actually pretty slim. You manage to balance a little bit, but whenever you try to get enough momentum, your jerking fails to get you off the first rung. You try again a few times, but eventually the latch breaks, and you fall back on your feet, losing your balance and tripping backwards, falling over Johan. He tries to catch you, but can’t really handle it, and he also falls back on his butt, as you land on his lap.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Thanks for the catch! I guess you are the hero to save me, after all!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan blushes and is completely speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh… could you get up, please? You’re kinda heavier than you look…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You apologize as you get up and dust yourself. You offer Johan a hand to help him up, but he refuses, keeping his hands over his lap, his face completely red. Oh, well. I guess it’s time to go back in. Pity that you broke the salmon ladder, though, as you kinda feel like you would like to train there again. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> </span>`

As you open the fan-printed comic, you see a well-endowed lady wearing a T-shirt that says “MEGA MILK”, cupping her own massive breasts and a face that is… well, “delight” might just not make justice to describe her expression. You can’t quite understand what the Japanese characters are saying, but the irritated blond boy sitting on the floor, with a pillow over his hips… seems suggestive enough.<br><br>Once Johan comes to his senses again, he spots you, and turns purple. With wide eyes and complete silence, he snaps the comic from your fingers and points away, mouthing the words “Excuse me”, while he locks himself in the bathroom.<br><br>Amused, you make your way back to your apartment, playfully fondling your breasts in delight with a smile.`

        content: `You reach Johan’s apartment, and unsurprisingly, find the door unlocked. Feeling slightly mischievous, you waltz right in unannounced. You can see Johan’s leg straddled over his sofa, he seems to be laying down and playing a duel on Super Slap Bros. Kerfuffle on his GameSphere. He’s controlling Marco, the mustachioed Spanish chimney-cleaner, on a heated battle against his brother, Lucio. Since you are on this playful mood, you just tumble haphazardly over the sofa, rolling over him on your way to the ground.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"OOF!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You hit the floor with a loud THUMP! Johan loses his concentration for a moment, allowing Lucio to hit a Charged Slap Attack that makes Marco to fly off the screen. Johan is so immersed in the fight he doesn’t even seem to react to your gaming faux-pas, but he is definitely more determined to beat his electronic avatar’s brother now - damn, he even SAT UP. Things are about to get serious!<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"If only you joined forces, those chimneys wouldn’t stand a chance!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You help yourself to some peanuts he had in a bowl, as you become his silent audience in the fight. He seems to be pretty evenly matched with the computer, and the duel goes on. And on. And on…<br><br>After a while, this starts getting a bit boring. You look around, and see that there’s another controller on a nearby shelf. You take it in your hand, and press the big red START button.<br><br>“HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!”<br><br>You pop into the arena as Princess Watermelon, and as you fall still in your invulnerable state, you use your Hip Check special move to bump Lucio out of the screen, clearing his last stock. It’s now only you and Marco. Johan seems to break momentarily from his trance, and looks at you with a “it’s on!” face. You smile as you tacitly accept the challenge.<br><br><span id="choice1"><<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Let’s cheese this! I’m gonna button-mash my way into victory!">><<replace "#choice1">>Johan is good, and it’s been ages since you last player Slap Bros. He is constantly dodging almost everything you can throw at him. But you don’t care how good he is, no one can beat your ultimate strategy: randomly pressing buttons as fast as you possibly can!<br><br>There is a certain finesse to your… well, it can hardly be described as anything but a whirlwind of chaos. Princess Watermelon is all over the stage, a true unstoppable force of nature. Marco is forced to stand back, and Johan’s tactical playstyle certainly is affected by the sheer madness your avatar exudes.<br><br>You actually manage to leave quite a bit of destruction in your wake, the breakable arena in shambles and creating a lot of pitfalls. Things are more dangerous than ever… you both are in the zone…<br><br>In one of your desperate moves, you surprise Johan with an untimely dash and he dodges backward, only to slip into one of the newly-formed pitfalls. You watch him falling, as you extend your hands in the air with a loud and taunting “WHOOP!”...<br><br>But as you turn to look at Johan, he’s smiling… when you turn your head back to the screen, he performs an incredible triple jump followed by a special, using his ladder-grab to switch places with Princess Watermelon! By the time your hands are back on the controller, it’s too late, and you hear the announcer shouting “GAME!” <</replace>><<script>>$("#part2").css("display", "block");<</script>><<Failed>><<replace "#choice1">>You played Slap Bros. a long time before before, and you remember some of the commands, but your only hope is to… well… use old faithful: cheesing it. You start mashing with your thumbs, but as he clearly knows how to dodge and counter, you get desperate and lay the controller down and just start using your fingers in true chaotic mode!<br><br>Princess Watermelon flails around the stage, throwing as many taunts as actual attacks, and the sheer madness of it does shock Johan momentarily, but not enough to make a difference. He quickly starts dispatching all lives you had in stock, until you both are left with one stock left. Uh oh!<br><br>You redouble your mashing, but it’s a futile effort. Like before, he just waits for that one opportunity and snipes you, sending Princess Watermelon over the edge. You watch as she descends into the pit, moments before the announcer shouts “GAME!”<</replace>><<script>>$("#part2").css("display", "block");<</script>><</PersonalityCheck>><<link "Johan seems to know what he’s doing… I should play this safe.">><<replace "#choice1">>Being quite rusty at Slap Bros., you try to replicate Johan’s tactical playstyle, but it’s a bloodbath. Or a sootbath, given Marco’s deadly creosote-laden brush. When a Magic Broccoli pops-up right next to you, you grin as you expect to become a giant and trounce him - making you involuntarily flex all your muscles and enlarge yourself in real-life in anticipation…<br><br>But it wasn’t to be. Marco uses his ladder-pull move and grabs the Broccoli right from under your nose, and becomes himself a giant. Uh oh…<br><br>You watch as the giant mustachioed man tramples all over the stage, grabbing poor Princess Watermelon as tossing her around like a tennis ball repeatedly, quickly dwindling your stock of lives before the effect ends. In a moment of introspection, your brain momentarily wonders if this is how people feel around you lately due to your recent growth. And before you actually concentrate back on the game, you can already hear the announcer shouting “GAME!”<</replace>><<script>>$("#part2").css("display", "block");<</script>> <</link>></span><span id="part2" style="display: none;"><<if $skills[3].level > 3>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"REMATCH!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You proclaim loudly, your gaming honor in jeopardy. You are not about to let your crown slip. Certainly not without a proper fight. You immediately repeatedly press the large green button until a new arena appears.<<else>><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"GG!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You scowl at your friend.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That’s not fair, I haven’t played in a while!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, do you want a rematch? It’s not like I have a ton to do right now…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You smile and nod, decided to show him you have some fight in you. Johan cues up another fight.<</if>><br><br>The new arena is displayed on the loading screen, an old west street. How appropriate! As the announcer kicks off the match, the air is electrical - it really feels like a high-noon showdown. The two of you grin, anticipating what is to come.<br><br>And it’s off! Both Marco and Princess Watermelon dash backwards, opening some space. Johan opens with a charged attack, and you dodge carefully. But before you can recover, he’s closed in for a grab! You try to get away by mashing, but he pounds on you - and soon the avatar is tossed off-screen, taking your precious stock.<br><br>You aren’t letting him off easy, though! With redoubled enthusiasm, you remember that your character has a special move that can absorb incoming attacks and redirect them! As you linger in your invincibility frames, you taunt Marco (with a move in which Princess Watermelon waggles her respectable hump towards the screen) and Johan uses the time for a long charge move. You smile deviously, using your move as you approach him, and add his attack power to your own - still surprised, he doesn’t respond in time before you knock him out of the park.<br><br>This back and forth goes on for a bit, until both of you are down to your respective last stock. Your hands are starting to get a bit sweaty with the excitement, and you grip the controller tighter and tighter. In your excitement, you don’t hear the small creak of the plastic. Suddenly, a Final Slap Orb manifests over the arena, close enough that Marco can grasp it! The chimney sweep now glows with power as the whole play area darkens, and you know that if that move connects, it’s game over for you. You take a deep breath, and brace as the avatar menacingly steps towards you…<br><br>And then, a gift from the RNG gods themselves! A paralysis mine spawns right in front of Marco, and the character is briefly stunned! You run towards him, and start powerfully mashing the main attack button repeatedly, with the same speed that the leggy royal uses in her blindingly fast mortal lightning kick to activate the move that would grant you the trophy…<br><br>…<br><br>If it wasn’t for the sickening sound of plastic and silicon cracking.<br><br>Princess Watermelon and Marco just stand there, immobile, a mirror image of you and Johan.<br><br>You look at the mess of plastic, metal and wire within your hands. The poor indigo-colored controller shattered, powerless against your sinewy hands. You feel bad as you look at Johan, who is staring at your hands, slack-jawed.<br><br>But something feels off. He’s not mad at you for breaking his controller, or surprised with your sheer grip power. No, there’s melancholy in his eyes?<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"..."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… whoops? I guess I got a bit carried away there… look, I’ll get you a new controller, okay?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And still, Johan looks sadly at the kid-toy colored jumble on your hands. You try to sort of reconnect the two bits, but only succeed in further pulverizing the edges of cracked hard plastic.<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That controller… that was the controller that was signed by Hideo Naka, the creator of Marco and Lucio… my dad took me to meet him when he came for the launch of Slap Bros.

It seems like he can literally relive the moment, seeing the whole thing replay in his eyes. You feel deeply for him, and this just won’t stand.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That’s so awesome…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You stand up decisively.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wait here, I’ll be right back!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You run back to your apartment, and collect some makeshift supplies as fast as you can. You then hurry back, bag in hand, and Johan’s melancholy is now mixed with confusion and surprise. As you spread your crafting tools, you fish the most recognizable and colorful plastic bits, and your brain starts working on overdrive.<br><br>Your hands deftly handle the parts, attaching them to the picture frame one by one, and you try your best to see what can be salvaged of the signature - but you can’t really do much.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Wait! It’s time for MY superpower!."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan goes to his closet, and brings his hobby kit, the same one he uses to assemble models. He gets all the plastic bits he can find, and puts them under his magnifying glass. Using tweezers and glue, he gets to work in reconstructing the messy remains of the controller.<br><br>The two of you proceed to spend the next hour working side by side - you making a nice diorama with the internal parts of the device, while he recreates the signature.<br><br>Time flies as you two join forces. It’s as if, together, there’s nothing you two can’t accomplish. And as the project takes shape, you seem to accomplish the impossible. You ask for a printout of the picture of the day he got the signature, which you work into the little display.<br><br>As you two join your efforts, hair disheveled and all four hands sticky with glue, you watch the finished product, sharing a giddy smile over the fruits of your labor. Johan looks at you with the sweetest and most innocent smile.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Here! Just stand beside it!."<</Dialogue>><br><br>He poses you next to the diorama, and sets his phone to take a selfie by your side. You are not sure you’ve ever seen Johan this happy, and you are on the verge of tearing up. Still very wound-up, he runs to grab a cold bottle of soda, which he uses to make a toast with you.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"To the world’s best crafters!."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You “clink” the red plastic cups and you both take a big sip of the sugary beverage.

This is clearly very important to him… you raise your hand, wanting to console him, but as your gaze reaches your oversized, powerful palm, you pull it back. You resent your own size and strength in a way you hadn’t before.<br><br>For once, you actually wish so hard that Johan would go on one of his uncontrollable rambles, but he just stares at the remains of the crushed device. You force yourself to respond, against your better judgement.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, you’ll always have the memories, right?

I guess it’s time to go face Johan.<br><br><br><<elseif $johanControllerFixing == "fixed">><br>The box dropped by the guys from the Electronics Club was - well, you will never ask them to giftwrap any present ever. But the contents are a different matter: they seems to have really done some magic to Johan’s broken controller. Sure, you can tell it got cracked, but they also customized it with an artistic pattern that just gives it a cool weathered look, without compromising the autograph on the back. Frankly, it’s quite impressive.<br><br><br>You grab the device and take it for a spin. They must have replaced the internals completely, because the sticks and button feel tighter than before. In fact, if it wasn’t for the case, it actually feels brand-new. Huh.

Is it cool to have a rare piece of gaming memorabilia? Sure, but at the end of the day, these are just objects, you know?

You feel a weight on your chest, like all the air was taken from your lungs - it’s not that you are surprised that Johan has this side to him, but it still like you just found another whole dimension to your quirky, nerdy neighbor, just hiding under the surface. Biting your lip, you suppress a tear and just run to squeeze him in a bear hug.<br><br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh, just take it easy?

You make me feel special like that, too, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br>You are resting your chin on his shoulder with your eyes closed, so you don’t get to see Johan blushing violently, but you feel his body tensing. You let out a nervous giggle as you feel him tapping your back awkwardly, and you let go of him.<br><br><br>Unsure of what else to say, you slowly step backwards towards the door, hands behind your back. Johan smiles and nods, and thanks you once again under his breath. You turn to leave, with a gigantic smile brewing on your lips. Before you close the door, you hear Johan shouting.<br><br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Don’t be a stranger, now!

        content: `You decide to go check the building’s mailbox, and you find a cardboard tube that doesn’t fit just laying on the ground next to it. A quick glance reveals that it belongs to Johan - it must be the pin-up poster he ordered the other day. <<if $shyConfident > 1>> While there’s very few people coming and going in this building, you’d rather bring that to his apartment than leave it exposed there, where it could easily be nabbed by someone else. <<else>>You hesitate for a moment, trying to convince yourself if you should just grab his mail like that, but you wouldn’t want someone else stealing his precious (and possibly embarrassing) art, right?<</if>>So you grab the tube, and lean it against your shoulder as you make you way to Johan’s.<br><br>
<<if $shyConfident > 1>>Humming as you climb the stairs, you entertain the idea of coming in holding the unfurled poster in front of you, making a funny voice like it was the pin-up girl talking... but you decide that maybe going into someone else’s mail is crossing a line. Still, the idea brings a smile to your face. <<else>>As you slowly make your way up the stairs, you question whether he might feel embarrassed with you handling the poster. Actually, is it going to be awkward if you just show up with it? Maybe you should just pretend you think it’s something else completely unrelated, maybe make a joke about his art supplies - and spare everyone the embarrassment? <</if>>You realize that Johan really brings out this playful side in you, and you feel blessed for having him as a friend.<br><br>
But as you ponder how special the little guy is to you, you approach his door and hear a rhythmic thumping coming from inside. You can’t quite explain, but you can sense a weird vibe coming from inside - instead of the usual energetic and excitable one that his apartment exudes, there’s now frustration. The door is ajar, as per custom, but this time your sixth sense tells you to take a discreet peek before going in.<br><br>
You tilt your head and see Johan sitting down by his computer, slowly hitting his forehead against the desk next to his laptop, eyes closed. He seems incredibly frustrated and disappointed, which by itself is somewhat shocking. You resist the urge to go there and help the inconsolable student, trying to first figure out what is wrong. He bellows a very loud sigh, which transitions into a snickering sob. He raises his head, only to rest it against his hand, looking sideways at the computer screen, before talking to himself.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Come on, Johan, you can do this. This isn’t rocket science. Though actually, I kinda wish it was - I probably know more about that than picking a place for a date. Girls are HARD, man!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You blush, taking a step back as your heart accelerates and your eyes widen. Johan has a girlfriend? I mean, you are glad about that, he certainly deserves to be happy. So why does it make you uncomfortable? You find yourself clenching your jaw and hand, <<if $muscle >= 45>>accidentally crushing the thick cardboard tube like it was made of paper, <</if>>surprising yourself at how upset you are by that. Still, he’s your friend. You should give him your full support... right?<br><br>
As you approach the door again, he continues to talk to himself, and you end up observing more before barging in, curiosity getting the best of you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"How can I be so pathetic? I’m sure most guys just do this without even thinking, and here I am, unable to pick a simple idea for a date. God, Johan, you are pathetic."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He hits his forehead against the table once again, and it just about breaks your heart.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I mean, yeah, there’s all the obvious stuff, like dinner and a movie kinda thing, but she’s so special - she deserves something extraordinary. Like herself. I can’t just phone in this one! No, I gotta knock this one out of the park, because she’s going to laugh at me if I do something lame like that - I bet she gets asked for all kinds of amazing stuff. She’s just so cool..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You find yourself banging your free fist against the wall instinctively... <<if $muscle >= 70>>cracking the structure and making the ground shake. This startles Johan, who rushes towards his shelf full of figures, prepared to cushion them should some fall from the unexpected tremor. Oops.<<elseif $muscle >= 45>>it makes a very loud noise, and Johan immediately looks at the door. Uh oh! But luckily he seems too stressed to follow up. Phew!<<else>>Oops! You shrink, hoping Johan didn’t hear that. You wait a second before sneaking a peek, but it seems like you are safe.<</if>><br><br>
Johan takes a deep breath, and goes back to his search, staring glumly at the cold screen. You bite your lip so hard it almost bleeds, and decide that enough is enough. You can’t let him suffer like that. Despite your best judgement, you decide to intervene. Closing your eyes, you sigh, and step into the apartment.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Johan! You’ve got mail!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan looks like a deer under headlights, and immediately closes his browser as you approach. Unsurprisingly, he is really bad at trying to pretend he was doing something else, as he suspiciously crosses his legs, starts whistling and starts a racing game. You make your way to his desk to drop the cardboard tube, while he turns at you with a very forced smile.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, hey, <<print $playerFirstName>>, didn’t see you there! Sup?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You can’t even get mad at him, he looks totally adorable trying to pretend he was doing something else.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, what are you up to? Just chilling with your, huh, racing game? Thought you were more in the fighting scene."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"No, I’m SUPER serious about racing. Like, all the cylinders, and the, huh, laps, with uh, the stripped flag, you know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You mean checkered flag?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan’s face blushes, and he stutters as the game finishes loading - and crashes just as hard as his excuse. As the window closes, there’s another browser behind it, showing the homepage for a fancy restaurant in town, with a reservation form being filled out.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Chez Manon? Isn’t this that fancy French restaurant with that famous chef that opened here in town? I hear she’s got so many stars she doesn’t even know what to do with them. But just like racing games, not something I expected from you..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan gets really stiff and tense, and you can practically hear the gears in his brain grinding.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, yeah, no, my cousin is coming to visit, and she was asking if there were any nice places to eat."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I suppose, but it seems like it’s a really romantic place, you don’t want to give her the wrong idea, right? I mean, which girl wouldn’t love being asked on a date there?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Y-y-you really think so?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
His blush deepens, getting dangerously close to purple territory, but his panic is replaced by hope as he seems truly relieved to get your approval.<br><br>

            You can’t help but feel a little petty, yet, you’d be lying if you said that there wasn’t a sliver of relief for chopping any competition you might’ve had in the process. Huh. It turns out, you might be a lot more possessive of Johan than you realized.<br><br>
            Still, that doesn’t change the fact that you’ve never seen Johan feeling this dejected before. You can almost feel the weight of the little devil and the little angel on your shoulders. Torn, you waffle between the options ahead of you, nervously pondering what you should do next.<br><br>

            Your original instinct was to emphasize that you were surprised someone agreed to go out with him, but it came out all wrong - it should be pretty obvious that you are more annoyed by the fact he might be doing so. You can only hope his obliviousness won’t detect the not-so-subtle edge of jealousy in your line. Thankfully, it’s Johan we’re talking about...<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, I haven’t quite made the invitation per se, I guess. I’m kind of a planner type of person, so I wanted to, you know, have something special to offer before I, huh..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Ugh! How can this nerd be so adorable?!? It’s like he’s not even trying! While you still kind of didn’t want to see him going out with whoever the lucky girl or guy is, you roll your eyes and realize you aren’t mean enough stand in the way of the lil’ guy’s happiness.<br><br>

            Johan looks even more awkward as you make these half-hearted offers, fiddling and stuttering as he avoids direct eye contact. You just wait there, impatiently and mildly bothered by his demeanor until he actually manages to produce his next sentence.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, you see, I don’t think I will need much help, I see this girl all the time, you know, because she lives here in the building, and we basically treat each other’s apartment like a second home as it is."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

<<if ['sexy', 'stylish'].includes($outfit.style())>>
    You spend quite a bit of time getting all dolled up, with the nicest clothes you own, and even watch a couple of make-up tutorials online to try and make yourself as presentable as you can. <<if $breasts >= 40 && $shyConfident > 1>>Making the most of your outfit, you work that cleavage to REALLY pop, and after looking at the mirror, you are certain Johan will have a hard time ignoring your assets.<</if>>
<<elseif ['casual', 'tomboy', 'girly', 'nerdy'].includes($outfit.style())>>
    You try to keep your outfit on the more casual side, hoping not to put too much pressure on Johan. Besides, you figure it’s probably for the best to play on his court anyway - if his taste in figures is any indication, you are fairly confident he probably goes head over heels for a girl next door type anyway.
<<elseif ['sporty'].includes($outfit.style()) && $muscle >= 45 || $dick > 9>>
    You make sure to pick a sporty and skin-hugging outfit that properly accentuates your best newfound assets - <<if $muscle >= 45>>and after a quick flex, you smile as you realize you can see every contour of your burgeoning muscles.<</if>><<if $dick > 9>>A quick look at your crotch confirms that your bulge is hard to ignore.<</if>> You give a last spin in front of the mirror, confident that your outfit will turn a few heads - or at least the specific one you want to.
<</if>><br><br>
Happy with your looks, you walk towards the building door, where you find someone waiting for you - but you need to do a double-take before you realize who it is. Whoa, it looks like Johan also went all out for this date!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You smile as you approach Johan, who is wearing a formal white shirt (complete with pens in his pocket) and dress pants - he looks like the stereotype of an IT worker, which you assume to be his attempt at looking fancy. It’s kind of adorable, frankly. GASP! He even seems to have combed his hair (though it still maintains a certain air of unruliness, and you pity the poor brush that had to face such a mighty opponent). He also seems to have ditched his glasses in favor of contacts, and put on some nice cologne. You approach him, unable to hide your silly smile.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>? Is that you? <<if $muscle >= 45 || $breasts >= 45 || $height >= 195>>I’m guessing so from your unique figure. <</if>>I am actually asking, I can’t really see very well without my glasses?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You notice his eyes having a hard time focusing on you, as he sort of squints while you approach.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"I tried ordering some contact lenses, but I lost them on the sink, and then I couldn’t find my glasses either, now I’m kinda lost here but... it IS you, right? I just feel like it is you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You approach the little dork and give him a peck on the cheek. Wow, he REALLY went in for the cologne. It does smell good, it’s just... he seems to have applied it with a ladle instead of a sprayer.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, it is me, silly. You look really nice, by the way."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan blushes, smiling in your general direction. It feels a bit like he’s looking at those hidden 3D images, not quite focusing on you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do you want me to go up and find your glasses for you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"Nah, I don’t want to be late for our reservation. Let’s just get going, I can see... mostly."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"<<if $shyConfident > 1 || $submissiveDominant > 1>>Oh, no, I’m not going on a date with you and not letting you see how I look, here, give me your keys, I’ll find your stuff!<<else>>Sorry, I can’t in good conscience let you out without the ability to see. Can I have your keys? I’ll be in an out and we can get going - you won’t even notice.<</if>>"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He grabs the keys from his pocket and hands it to you. You rush up, anxious to get going, and after traversing a tactile cloud of cologne, you find a case of contact lenses on the bathroom sink, as he said, and bring it down to him. He fumbles it a little bit, but manages to get them on, and as he looks at you, his jaw drops. You blush a little bit, and extend your hand, which he gladly grabs as you two get going.<br><br>
It’s surprisingly chilly for summer as the sun lowers in the horizon, <<if $shyConfident > 0>>and you just wrap your arm around Johan’s, coming closer to him. You can hear him audibly gulping, which just makes him seem even more adorable.<<else>>and you are giddy to hold hands with your favorite nerd. Both of you seem to avoid each other’s gaze, still somewhat embarrassed and unsure on how to proceed. But you give his hand a squeeze, and he squeezes back, bringing smiles to both of your faces.<</if>><br><br>
It’s hard to describe why you are so excited, but you feel butterflies fluttering in your stomach from this simple act of just walking hand in hand. <<if $muscle >= 50 || $height >= 200>>It’s true that Johan’s palm is swimming in your larger hand, which makes you feel somewhat protective of him - it’s not something you ever thought of, but it also makes you feel all fuzzy. <<if $height >= 205>>The only downside is that the considerable height gap between the two of you makes leaning so he can hold your hand a bit awkward.<</if>><</if>> Occasionally, you two turn your heads to look at each other, taking turns at opening your mouths but never quite managing to say anything meaningful, and then sort of just giggling at how silly you are. If it was someone else, you might think they are crazy, but you two are in heaven during this stroll.<br><br>
That changes, however, once Johan puts his hand free hand in his pants pocket. You can clearly see him getting more fiddly, and constantly checking it. Something is bothering him, and you can’t just ignore that.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is something wrong?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"N-no, it’s nothing. Sorry."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan, what is bothering you? You can tell me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"Ha, it’s silly. It’s just, this restaurant is a bit on the pricier side, so I took some money out to pay for dinner, and I’m just not used to walking around with so much cash - so I keep checking that I still got my wallet, y’know."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                This gets him completely off-guard. His entire body stiffens, and his eyes bug out even more than usual.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"No, I wasn’t implying that you couldn’t, I just... wanted to do something nice, it has NOTHING to do with you being a woman.

                Johan smiles and nods. But you can feel that something is changed - this exchange got him in a more pensive mood.<<set $flag.johanDatePensive to true>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, cheer up!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Same here! I am really glad I met you, Johan!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                He beams with pride, and squeezes your hand, as you finish making your way to the restaurant.<br><br>
            <<else>>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I’m flattered, Johan, but I wasn’t expecting you to foot the bill all by yourself! Just because I’m a woman doesn’t mean I can’t a... fford... my... own... How much do you figure it’s going to cost?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"I checked the reviews online, I’m guessing it’s going to be like 50 bucks per person?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You blush heavily, realizing that this might be a bit more than you can afford right now. Wincing, you didn’t expect to bite your tongue this early into the date.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m not imposing if I ask you to pay for me, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Johan smiles, proudly, as he says with a lot of gusto:<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "JohanFancy" "Johan">>"Hey, I was the one who invited you - I got this. Best money I have ever spent, if you ask me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You turn around in front of Johan, and just squeeze him into a tight hug<<if $height >= 180 && $muscle >= 50>>, lifting him off the ground in the process<</if>>. He lets out a wheezing laugh, and you let go of him, knowing deep inside that he wouldn’t make fun of your faux pas.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You sure this isn’t going to keep you from getting any figures you really wanted or anything like that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                He says it super casually, but you are almost floating on air right now. You squeeze his palm, as the both of you approach the restaurant.<br><br>

            Whoa, things took a bit of a dark turn there. You wrap your arm around Johan’s shoulder and pull him in closer.<br><br>

You get to his door, which is surprisingly fully closed. You raise your fist to knock, but once again hesitate. Taking a deep breath and raising yourself a dozen times to your tiptoes as you build courage, you grimace, and finally rap your knuckles against the door.<br><br>
You think about calling his name, but you decide to give it some time, hoping he’ll just shout back casually. Instead, you hear some footsteps approaching. Each makes your stomach churn more, as you tighten your fists in anticipation.<br><br>
The door finally opens slightly, with that familiar pair of blue eyes staring at you - but without the usual sparkle you got so used to.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, <<print $playerFirstName>>, you need something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You feel no malice or resentment in his tone, but the guy is clearly not the energetic and excitable dude you would expect to find. He smiles at you, but it still feels like being stabbed in the chest, because you feel directly responsible for him not being that uncontrollable ball of nerd cheer.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, so, last time, I left and I said some stuff, I really didn’t want to leave things hanging like that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Deep inside, you expected Johan to just laugh it off, but you can sense a bit of melancholy behind his happy façade. He still doesn’t fully open the door, which makes you painfully aware that he still feels hurt.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Nah, I think you were right. I do need to grow a spine. I had some time to think, and I suppose you were right - I might just have been barricading myself behind my hobbies, because deep inside I knew I wasn’t cut out for this."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            And then it strikes you like lightning, and you feel the shock erupt from inside you with a ferocity you didn’t know you have until then. <<<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>You shove your foot in the door, and push it open, getting inside as Johan takes a step back, quite shocked.<<else>>With a sigh, you push the door open<<if $muscle >= 45>> with surprisingly little effort<</if>> and Johan looks at you, eyes so wide he almost drops his glasses.<</if>> You grab him by the shoulder and look directly at him, with a serious expression.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I am not going to dance around it. I got jealous, okay? You know why? Because I was spooked you had found someone and wouldn’t have time for me anymore, and I didn’t want to have to deal with the idea of sharing you with someone else. You know why? Because you are a great guy - energetic, passionate, funny, REALLY smart, and just fun to be with. Am I making myself clear now?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You find yourself almost panting, your breathing is so fast and deep, close to hyperventilation, <<if $muscle >= 50 && $height >= 170>>and you have involuntarily lifted the poor guy off the ground by his shoulders, <</if>>as Johan looks back at you, a mix of confusion, fear and bittersweet happiness. Before he can answer, you bring him in for a very tight hug.<br><br>
            Johan mumbles something, but he hugs you back before he actually properly articulates himself.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"T-t-thank you for the vote confidence. It does mean a lot to me, <<print $playerFirstName>>. But that doesn’t change the fact that I kinda had to hear that anyway. I had some time to think, and I realize I was a little too self-absorbed with my hobbies. I do have to put myself out there a bit more, get out of my comfort zone. Having someone like you around, who is literally evolving before my eyes, you know, I guess made me feel insecure. And it’s something I gotta deal with."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            And then, as you let go of him, he takes a step back and you see the good old Johan, with a big smile as bright as the sun.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Still, I do owe you an apology for saying hurtful things in a moment of weakness. You didn’t deserve that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<if $muscle >= 55>>You talking about a moment of weakness? Am I the only one to see the irony?<</if>> Uh, will you make you feel better if I say apology accepted?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            The comment makes both of you giggle. You feel a huge weight off your back, and the air seems to have cleared between the two of you.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Seriously, no worries. We are good. And maybe both of us learned important lessons, so it probably was for the better."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You give Johan a playful mock punch on the shoulder. <<if $muscle >= 40 && $carefreeCarefull < 2>>Still, you don’t quite know your own constantly-increasing strength, and Johan takes a step back not to fall down. You really should be more careful with that.<</if>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See, I told you how awesome you are, and here you go proving me right. Sooooo... we good for some hanging out this week?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I wouldn’t want it any other way."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You nod, and make your way back to your apartment, feeling much better about yourself. You really don’t deserve Johan.

            You awkwardly try to push your way into the apartment, <<if $muscle >= 45>>pushing the door and making Johan fall in the process. Dang, that’s no way to present an apology! You help him up, but it just seems to make him more hesitant.<<else>>attempting to shove your foot in the door to get in, but all you manage is to hit your forehead against the wood, which makes you scream in pain. Johan, concerned, opens the door and brings you in, trying to see if you are okay. Great! Not embarrassing at all, <<print $playerFirstName>>.<</if>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I’m making enough of a fool of myself here, Johan. My point is, I was being stupid because I was vulnerable, and I said stuff I shouldn’t have. It had NOTHING to do with who you are, which is my best friend since I moved here, okay?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Johan looks at you, with increasing concern.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You were worried about me?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, duh? You might not have noticed, but you’ve basically been my best friend and partner in crime since I moved here. You are my ride or die, Johan. Why do you think I freaked out when you suggested you were going on a date with someone else?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            And then you can see it in his eyes, something clicks when you say that, and he just started laughing. He slaps your back, and comes in for a hug.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, <<print $playerFirstName>>, I guess this whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. Really, don’t sweat it, okay? We are good. Better than good, even!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You take a step back, confused. Why is he being so nice? Not that you are going to question that, you just want to make it up to him right now. So you just try to make sure:<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wait, so you aren’t made at me for saying all that shit? I still feel horrible, I really didn’t even mean that, it was just I was..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Don’t sweat it. I kinda had to hear that anyway, so it was for the best. I realize I was a little too self-absorbed with my hobbies.

And it’s something I gotta deal with."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You blink repeatedly. Wow, Johan really is growing up. You don’t see the dorky teen, but a grown man. It does not make the sting of having flubbed that hurt any less, but you can’t help but feel good for the lil’ guy.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, we good?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"We more than good!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            He offers his hand for a handshake. You kinda wanted something more, but it will have to do. You owe it to him. And so you offer your hand in return.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<if $muscle >= 45>>Wow, huh, that is one FIRM handshake! Did I ever mention that you are hella strong?!? Still...<</if>> Glad to settle this. Don’t lose sleep over it, at the end of the day, you helped me grow as a person. I really had to face that sooner or later."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Your lips tighten as you try your best to look happy for him - which you are, even if you wanted a different outcome. You let go of him hand, and come in for a tight hug.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, huh, okay. <<if $muscle >= 45>>Can you, just, loosen it a little bit? I can feel my vertebrae groaning a bit under the pressure...<</if>> Yeah, I’m good with a hug. Anyone ever tell you that you give the best hugs?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You giggle, and let go of him. How is it that Johan just makes you feel good, no matter what?<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I came here trying to apologize and make you feel better, and in the end I was on the receiving end of the pep talk. How pathetic is that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, don’t go steal my thunder now! I’m supposed to be the adorkable one, remember? I ain’t relinquishing that title any time soon!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"How come you always know exactly what to say to make me feel better?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That goes both ways. I am really happy you moved here. I don’t think I tell you that enough."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            An awkward pause goes on for forever as neither of you know what to say next.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, uh, I need to go back to my apartment now... w-would you mind if I, huh, showed up later to hang out?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You kiddin’ me? It hasn’t been the same here without you. Don’t you dare not to pop up unannounced like you always do!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Deal! I’ll see you around the, Johan. Take care!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You leave, closing the door behind you. It is a huge weight off your shoulders, but why does it feel like a crappy resolution to this whole affair? Well, at least you still have your good friend to count on going forward.

                The geek smiles at you, and you are once again reminded why you enjoy his company so much. With an exaggerated curtsy, you take your leave and return to your apartment. You can’t help but wonder about Johan, though. There’s something hard to explain, this wholesome, exciting and comforting aura about him. While you fear you may have blown your chance to take this to the next level, you can rest assured that Johan will be there for you when you need a friendly shoulder - or some advice about genre fantasy!

        content: `You arrive at Johan’s apartment’s door, anxious to see him again after his absence. You try to open the door, finding it uncharacteristically locked. Huh. You rap your knuckles against the wood, expecting a prompt response, and after a half-minute, it opens slightly..<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, hey! It’s you!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan looks even more disheveled than usual, but really happy to see you. Realizing who it is, the fully opens the door and invites you in.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I missed you, Johan. Is everything alright?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Me? Pffft, I’m great.

You say, playing with your fingers over the table and avoiding his gaze, trying to be as suggestive as you possibly can about your intentions.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"OH! Well, uh, I really didn’t want to impose. NOT THAT I WOULD’VE TURNED IT DOWN!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He tries to justify himself to avoid giving you the wrong idea, and it’s adorable, as usual.
<<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ah. It was weird, not having you around. But I was okay too."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan smiles. It’s clear he missed you too.
<</if>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, you know, we can hang out now, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"O-OF COURSE! What do you want? Should I get some snacks, maybe make some popcorn? Do you want me to put a movie going? Or I can get the board games out. And I can hook up Slap Bros. if you prefer?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

            <<if $flag.johanDatePensive or $flag.johanDateProtagonistStandsHerself or $flag.johanDateJohanDefendProtagonist>>
                But before you can finish the sentence, you can see Johan already slumping and getting uncomfortable. He turns his eyes away, and his smile slowly fades. It makes you frown, slightly weirded out by his reaction.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You sure you’re alright, Johan?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Y-yeah, sorry. I just think I don’t feel like going out, if you don’t mind."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                But you can’t help but get concerned with him. It’s pretty unusual for Johan to lose his usual excitement, especially over something so silly as just the invitation to go out.<br><br>
                <<if $carefreeCarefull > 1 || if $skills[2].level > 2 && >><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is this the stuff that happened when we went to the restaurant?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                He doesn’t answer, but his silence speaks volumes as he lowers his head and shrugs.
                <<else>>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s wrong, Johan?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                He tries to avoid the subject, but you are not about to just drop this. Putting your hands on your hips and looking at him sternly, he finally breaks and admits what is bothering him.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I dunno, it’s just that stuff that happened when we went out, it’s still sorta lingering in my head, and I guess I don’t quite feel like going out, y’know?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <</if>>
                You feel bad for him, by now you are kind of used to the reactions you get from your transformation, but this seems like both new ground for him - but might also be slightly triggering due to his own previous social interactions. You’d be lying if you said this wasn’t worrying you, but right now you really just want to enjoy his company, so you decide to put a pin on that.
            <<else>>
                <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I mean, we could, if you really want to, but why don’t we just hang out here, just the two of us?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                He says, in a hopeful tone, and you can more than read between the lines. The boy wants some quality time with you. <<if $shyConfident > 1>>And you can’t say you dislike that idea.<<else>>Oh. OH! Does he... is he expecting something else? You find yourself blushing, but also excited.<</if>>
            <</if>>
            Johan comes in and gives you a tight hug, and rests his head on your <<if $height >= 185>>chest<<else>>shoulder<</if>>. You wrap your arms around him, and you can hear him sigh happily. You close your eyes and spend some time just enjoying his touch - there’s something incredibly fulfilling about being touched by him, as well as enjoying holding him, taking in his warmth and his shape, caressing his back, arms, the nape of his neck, his messy hair. Before you know you it, the realization dawns that your hands have been exploring his contours for quite a while. Johan is also returning the favor, as his own hands travel from your shoulders to your hips, and as they travel through the space between your buttocks and your hamstrings, you shudder deeply, shaking like there’s an earthquake brewing inside you. Before you know it, something primal seems to take over instinctively from inside you, and you find yourself <<if $muscle >= 50>>lifting Johan off the ground, which he promptly responds by wrapping his legs around your waist, as you carry him to the sofa, stradling over him.<<else>>pushing Johan onto the sofa, which shocks him with a mix of surprise and excitement he can’t hide from his expression. You lick your lips as you approach and straddle him, pining the guy under you on the sofa as you remove your top.<</if>>

            You announce, eyeing Johan like a predator about to strike. When you bite your lip, Johan gulps loudly.

            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"OH!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            He looks around, filled with anxiety and nervousness, unsure of what to do. Great, now you made things awkward. But before you can think of a way to fix this mess, Johan just comes in and gives you a passionate kiss. Taken by surprise, despite his somewhat sloppy kissing ability, the two of you immediately engage in a heavy make out session and everything blurs. By the time you get some sense of awareness of what is going one, you are straddling him on the sofa, with your top off, while some two-way heavy petting action is already taking place.

        content: `As you make your way to Johan’s apartment, your mind starts reeling about what is going on with your relationship. Not that you necessarily want to put a label on it, but you can’t deny that things are clearly going ahead at a brisk pace, and maybe it’s better that you ensure both are on the same page?<br><br>
It’s a weird thought, but at the same time liberating. After all this tension, you can’t help but feel like you don’t need to hide your feelings for him anymore, and you barge into his apartment wearing the biggest and silliest smile ever...<br><br>
... only to find the usually hyperkinetic guy slouching on the couch, reading a comic, as he waves back with a warm smile. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but you kinda wished for a bit more excitement for seeing you. You squint at him, as you approach, and he does seem genuinely happy that you are there - just, not, you know, BEAMING with JOY.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Sup, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Wanna watch something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do you want to hit the movie theater? I hear there’s a horror movie matinee going on this week - sounds right up your alley!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Meh - not really in the mood to go out."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He just keeps his eyes firmly entrenched in his book. You put your hands on your hips, tapping your feet anxiously with a concerned expression. It’s not like you didn’t know Johan was a bit of a homebody, but you can’t help but notice that lately he’s been acting more like a hermit than anything else. If he could grow any facial hair, you absolutely feel like he would have a beard as long as that fake one he has in the closet.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Are you sure you are OK? You feel kinda... I dunno, I don’t want to say lazy, but I feel like I would need to drag you if I wanted to go out."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
He shrugs, his smile evaporating.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I mean, we got plenty of stuff to do here, comics, games, modeling..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You say it with a stern, almost motherly tone. Scratching his head, he put the book down.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I suppose, there IS a thing that’s been bothering me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You look at him, eager to find out what has he bummed and unwilling to go out.<br><br>
<<if !$flag.johanDatePensive && $flag.johanDateUneventful>>
    <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Spending time with you is pretty awesome, and I’ve been having such a great time, I don’t quite feel the appeal of having to deal with, well, other people and stuff."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
    At this point, your concern is quickly escalating to annoyance. You knew what you were getting into by dating a geek, but he might just be forcing you into drawing a line in the sand here. 
<<else>>
    <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Look, I don’t know that you will get it, but during our date - and don’t get me wrong, I loved going out with you - but it just sorta got me into thinking about a lot of stuff. I think you are the most amazing person in the world, but there’s already so much stuff you need to deal with right now, and out there people are just going to judge you on a surface level - it’s... just not fair."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<</if>>
Your foot is now tapping even more impatiently. No, that will not do.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"<<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>This funk just won’t do! Alright, I’m officially staging an intervention here.<<else>>Aw, Johan. I can’t bear to see you like this. There’s gotta be something...<</if>>"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You grab your phone and, with little planning or forethought, just let your instincts guide you. Miraculously, you trip on an answer in what can be described as no less than kismet.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, did you know there’s a renaissance fair going on in town right now?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Actually, yes, I remember reading something about it a while ag..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And I’m willing to bet you have some sort of costume somewhere you can put on RIGHT NOW, correct?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uhhhh, proba..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Let me guess - you might even be able to arrange something for me, how about it?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Erm..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You just start pushing him into the closet, and despite his half-articulated protests, he seems to have accepted the request. You pull a chair, and just watch as he goes over his clothes (just how many yellow sweaters does he have?!?).<br><br>
He tosses stuff around, and he finally unearths a plastic bag, and retrieving its contents you see the blue tunic with puffy sleeves and the equally-puffy pants - there’s even a hat! He even produces a freaking mandolin!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, this I gotta see - go ahead and change!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan complies, and you watch, licking your lips, as he undresses down to his underwear and gets into his bard costume. Wow, it looks really good on him!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That is AWESOME! You look like a proper Alan-a-Dale!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Johan blushes, and with a discreet smile, plucks a few chords on the mandolin. He might not be the best musician, but it’s not too shabby either!<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Any chance you might get something for me as well?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
