Well, his room is full of posters and figurines of various characters from comics and anime, so it\'s not a big stretch to assume that he enjoys this sort of media. A few days ago, you\'ve asked him about it and after talking your ears off about some movies and cartoons, he invited you to come and watch one with him. Since you had nothing to do today, you accepted his invitation. <br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "I\'m glad you showed up! I just got my hands on the newest Batguy vs SplendidMan and it\'s supposed to be awesome!"<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "I\'m guessing there are more of those movies?"<</Dialogue>><br>He nodded enthusiastically, and pointed towards his shelf, where a lot of comics are neatly laid out.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "There are six films based on the comic series, in which these superheroes are the main characters!"<</Dialogue>><br>Aaand there he goes, rambling about power levels, costume designs and who is the best fighter, all of which goes way over your head, since obviously you haven\'t read these comics. After a short while, Johan abruptly stops, probably realizing that he was boring you.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Ah, I shouldn\'t be wasting your time! Please sit down and I\'ll bring some snacks!"<</Dialogue>><br>With that he runs towards the kitchen and starts rummaging through the cabinets. He comes back a few minutes later, with a bowl of popcorn along with some chocolate and a myriad of snacks.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Here you go! Feel free to help yourself to anything here".<</Dialogue>><br>You glance somewhat apprehensively at the food laid out before you. Should you be really helping yourself? Your weight has gone up a little bit and you\'ll have to do something about it. You stare harshly at your stomach and waist, which admittedly have seen better days. Johan gives you a curious look, but judging from the slight amusement in his eyes, he noticed your mental struggle.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Don\'t worry, you look great! Besides, look at me, I should be the one worrying about gaining weight!"<</Dialogue>><br>He laughs heartily and points towards his not particularly big, but still noticeable potbelly. Knowing him, it\'s caused by not exercising enough and too much sitting indoors, playing games and eating snacks. All in all, you laugh at his joke, which does lift your mood a bit. <br><br>After that, you both sat down to watch the movie. You have to admit that it\'s somewhat understandable why Johan is such a big fan of superhero films, as it was definitely exciting! <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "I\'ve gotta say Johan, that was pretty cool!"<</Dialogue>><br>He beams proudly, and gives you a thumbs up.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "I\'m glad you liked it. If you ever wanna watch something together, I\'ll be happy to join you!"<</Dialogue>><br>The two of you spend some time together discussing the movie.

His eyes are still shimmering, certainly still envisioning himself as one of the gods... you wonder if he\'s picturing himself as Thor or Hercules... and frankly, you feel a bit of pity for him.<br><br>A couple of minutes pass. Any second now...<br><br>All of a sudden, Johan blinks a couple of times and his eyes focus on the two arms on the table.

This bit is going to take quite a lot of effort and finesse, but you think you can pull it off...<br><br>Focusing all effort downwards against the table, without breaking Johan\’s arm or hand, you push with all your might. You can see the table slightly bending and hear a faint creaking... yes... if you just push it that little bit more...<br><br><br>CRACK!<\b><br><br>The table splits in two, and you pretend to be as surprised as you can, jumping back and massaging your biceps.<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Damn, Johan, I didn\'t know you had it in you.

Just say go.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan, still grinning, shouts “GO!” with no warning, and throws his whole body against your arm. With little effort, you look at him wincing and grimacing, adorable like a little puppy throwing himself against an adult mastiff.<br><br>You let your friend tire himself out as you check the nails of your free hand. Damn, would you look at the time? With little fanfare, you slam his hand against the table in a quick but controlled slam, making him fall out of his chair in the process.<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Hey... are you ok?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He is on the ground, eyes closed in shame, grabbing his arm.<<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Yeah. Nothing broken... except maybe for my pride?<</Dialogue>><br><br>You go around the table and help him get up.

I should know better that I am no god of thunder. You, on the other hand? Damn, it feels like on your way to becoming a super-heroine if you keep growing at this pace<</Dialogue>><br><br>You blush slightly, and thank him for the compliment. At least he seems excited enough about your friendship not to dwell too hard on his loss. And with that, you take your leave.<<elseif $muscle >= 25>>This ought to be fun.

You can feel your biceps and trapezius tensing with effort, a small bump proudly popping on your upper arm. Instead of focusing on the match, you just watch, mesmerized, at that humble but hard-earned mound. Time slows to a crawl as you smile with pride at your physical accomplishment, and your mind wanders... how big could you possibly get if you put the effort in?<br><br>Still entranced, you just drive Johan\'s hand against the table.

Still... you seem to be getting pretty strong, <<print $playerFirstName>>.<</Dialogue>><br><br>That comment... you freeze for a bit, a huge smile growing on your face, just like your biceps did just moments ago.

You keep looking at them, and you find yourself surprisingly turned on - the ripped quads, the action poses with swords, the most incredible tits you’ve ever seen… there’s nothing you don’t like in these photorealistic depictions of women at peak physical condition.<br><br>

Some of the players are changing into different roles, and undressing right there and then. Wow! You start looking around at all the options, as a short guy who is running the operation approaches you, and with a quick glance, proclaims he has the PERFECT outfit for you.

It dawns on you that, being an orc, means you won’t be on Johan’s team.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Damn, this is kind of weird, but you are almost buying into the role-play here, as you just swing your club and send everyone in your path flying - literally. They must be pretending, right? There’s no way you are strong enough to just be tossing people a few <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>meters<<else>>yards<</if>> away, and you are not even really trying that hard. Still, these people must have some serious stunt experience!<br><br> As you go clearing your path, you spot Johan, apparently being targeted because of the way he turned the tides on the last match. Almost everyone is crowding on top of him, and they are coming in aggressively and violently. Something snaps on your head - you forget that he is the enemy, and you just start running towards him, tackling everyone - friend or foe - that stands between you and him.<br><br> As you arrive into the big mess, you just come to a screeching stop, and use your momentum to hit your club against the ground. You can feel earth shaking, and so do the others, as they turn to you and freeze. Still not quite back to your senses, you just find yourself angrily tossing everyone away from Johan as if they were ants, and by the time you are done, you are the last two standing there.<br><br> However, as you look at Johan’s terrified visage, you realize that you are, in fact, his foe. Before you can make any sense of the situation, he silently kneels, and raises his staff horizontally towards you with both hands in an offering. Oh no, did you just screw this whole thing up?!? You feel pretty bad as you turn around, and see everyone still sort of recovering across the entire field - maybe they WEREN’T pretending after all? You left a veritable trail of devastation… you turn around, and just hug Johan, lifting him clear off the ground as you apologize for your stupid LARP faux-pas.<br><br> But then, you are surprised by something else… EVERYONE starts cheering wildly. What?<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"THAT… WAS… EPIC!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You see some of the people who were filming with their phones going nuts - apparently, you are already trending online on social media, and everyone is amazed - if a bit shaken - with your performance. People are describing this as the LARP of the year, no, the decade, NAY, THE CENTURY!<br><br> The crowd invites you over for some mead and celebration, but you realize you are still a bit in shock yourself, and it won’t be easy getting rid of all this green paint, so you say your goodbyes.<br><br> <<elseif $muscle >=45>> He comes back with a skimpy metal armor and a big sword - I guess it’s time for barbarian <<print $playerFirstName>>, huh? Well, at least it’s quick to change, and it REALLY puts your muscles on display.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> You carry your sword proudly… and frankly, that seems to be enough. Your figure is so imposing that most foes just cower as you poke them with your foam sword, quickly dispatching everyone in your way. You spot Johan, who after becoming MVP of the last match seems to be the target of many enemies - but not on your watch! You rush to his defense, and beautifully executes a true ballet of a swordfight, plowing through the enemies with shock and awe.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ll escort you, let’s go take down that general!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan is so stunned (either by your amazing display or sword mastery or your incredible muscular physique, you are not sure which one) that he just follows in silence. No matter - you proceed to clear a path straight into the enemy base, finding their orc general - it’s a big guy, and he DOES look quite intimidating, as he flips his axe around like a veritable martial arts master!<br><br> You are frozen for a second, having found your match… but neither of you were ready for what happened next: Johan points his staff at you, and shouts:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"RIGHTEOUS MIGHT!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are still frozen and confused, but Johan whispers:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"It doubles your height and multiplies your weight by 8 - increasing your Strength +4 and Constitution +2!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look at the orc general with an evil smile, and you flex every muscle in your body! Your opponent freezes and you see terror in his eyes as you feel yourself growing, every muscle tigheting and become bigger and denser! You could almost swear that the ground looks just a little farther away than before as you pull an inclined epic double-biceps pose, holding your sword aloft in the air. The general’s legs are now visibly shaking, as you strike him - he manages to defend with his enormous axe, but it just breaks in half and you hit him in the forehead!<br><br> The poor guy falls to the ground, and you immediately drop your foam sword in shock, going to check on him. He’s a bit shaken, but he guarantees he’s alright… you help him up, and the entire crowd goes wild! You proceed to give them a little show of your muscles, and everyone cheers even louder. You pick Johan up, and set him on your shoulder, thanking him for the boost. Weirdly, he feels absurdly light, almost as if the spell had worked for real. Ha, you wish!<br><br> You join the others for some merriment, and combat stories are traded among the participants. If you knew LARPing was this much fun, you’d have joined the group a long time ago!<br><br> <<elseif $muscle >=30 && $height >=175>> He brings you a sleek elf ranger costume, complete with a big compound bow and quiver. Nice! You are impressed with how snug it is, making you seem even taller - but also putting all your curves on display. You suspect you might be a little distracting among other LARPers, as you head for the battlefield.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> You don’t know what this costume is doing to your brain, but you almost feel like you have superhuman reflexes and speed. You run across the field, grabbing your bow and just mowing through all opponents almost like you had been doing this for centuries. Your strong legs and arms allow you to zip among the combatants with speed and ease, and pack quite a wallop with your bowstring. Hell, if you knew this was so fun, you’d be LARPing years ago!<br><br> You spot Johan in a bit of a bind, though, as he’s being surrounded by a slew of opponents. Not on your watch, though! You rush to his defense, executing a sliding approach, and you just machine gun an entire side of baddies with 5 perfectly - which stuns the others enough to allow Johan to dispatch the remaining forces with relative ease. Now unencumbered by insurmountable odds, he nods silently and the two of you know exactly what to do - you march on towards the enemy commander.<br><br> The two of you come in like a force of nature, in perfect sync mowing all obstacles that stand between you and the main event. As you see the enormous orc general, you look at a tall tree, and at Johan, and with another nod, it’s like you just had a telepathic conversation. You rush towards the tree, climbing it like it was nothing. Standing on a high branch, you dispatch the defense, while Johan prepares his ultimate spell!<br><br> Amazingly, everything goes as planned, and the two of you claim the battle, and the whole team comes to cheer. Without even thinking, you jump from the tall branch as if you really WERE an elf, and have a slight moment of panic as you realize that gravity very much applies to you still. But you land with a loud THUD! The ground shakes… but you just executed a perfect superhero landing without even realizing! The crowd goes wild, and everyone just grabs and starts carrying the two of you, tossing their two heroes up to the skies to celebrate.<br><br> After things calm down a bit, you look at Johan, who seems exceedingly proud of the shared accomplishment. Once again, a nod is all it takes for the two of you to know exactly what the other is thinking. This moment will live on in legends!<br><br> <<elseif $height <= 155>> He comes with a fairly nondescript peasant costume, and you realize that it lacks shoes - did he really just hand you a halfling costume? COME ON, you are NOT that short! You begrudgingly don the outfit, and prepare for battle.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Your toy sword feels about as demeaning as your costume, and you just sort of wing it on the battlefield. On the bright side, no one really cares about taking you on. On the other hand, you really don’t feel like much of an opportunity to do anything worth notice. You kinda just coast through the battle, watching it from inside. Once you spot Johan, though, you decide to come in for support!<br><br> Johan… errr… JO-HAN, the Magnificent, seems to be a pretty balanced character, alternating between support of others and tackling some minor foes. You help take some of the heat off of him, when he spots the commander of your team get surrounded.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"We must assist our leader! Mayhaps thou could gather some allies while I run to support him! Hark, those berserkers!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> It takes a second for you to process ye oldeth English, but once you figure it out, the plan is simple enough. You go enlist the berserkers, and run to Johan and the commander. The heat is on, and a lot of the bigger creatures are gathering around them. You watch as Johan systematically dispatches the weaker foes, and you try to run interference to give the commander some extra time to tackle the bigger threats.<br><br> Then, Johan, or rather, JO-HAN, the Magnificent, unleashes his powerful blinding spell at the perfect moment, giving your team the opportunity to flip the situation completely! With this battalion dispatched, the remaining forces run towards the enemy commander. But you get so excited that a sneaky Tiefling ends up getting the jump on you with a mortal blow.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"NOOOOOOOOO!!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan… or rather, JO-HAN, the Magnificent, comes to your side, holding your pretend-lifeless corpse, almost in tears. You whsiper:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, Johan? I’m a goner, go help the team, you wanna be there for the exciting climax, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"What wretched journey, for one does not beget their destiny from such follies. Must the innocent be the first to fall? NO, I say!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What are you doing?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"To die, perchance, to dream… these foibles betray my determination, as I cannot leave my most dear companion behind, even if the world may fall!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You open an eye, looking at Johan’s face… he seems to 100% mean every word, with sincere melancholy on his face… you feel a tear welling up on your eye…<br><br> And then the MC toots the horn, to announce the victory of your side, and Johan drops you back on the ground to celebrate. You hit your head, not enough to hurt, but it’s a bit of a shock. You can’t help but giggle as you see Johan running to join in the festivities of your other teammates.<br><br> Ah, never change, Johan. Never change.<br><br> <<else>> You get a simple generic rogue costume… not much to write home about, and you wonder if you should feel offended by it. Still, beggars can’t be choosers, so you change and get ready for the show.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Using your pitiful foam dagger, you run around sneakily trying to backstab people who are in the middle of other duels. It works fairly well, as you aren’t really calling much attention. You finally spot Johan… errr… JO-HAN, the Magnificent. He seems embroiled in a battle against three goblins, and it isn’t looking good. You run there as fast as you can, and immediately dispatch one of them with a backstab. YES! Now the odds are evened, and each one of you have your own goblin to tackle. JO-HAN has no trouble with his, but you sweat a bit trying to defend yourself from his mace with just the dagger.<br><br> You manage to execute a beautiful rolling tumble as he strikes you, just barely missing his mace as you land behind him, and stab him from behind! He falls to the ground, and you get up and go hug Johan in the excitement of the moment…<br><br> Which turns out to be a pretty stupid mistake, as it leads an incoming necromancer to get both of you in your distraction. Oh, well… at least the time you spent playing was more fun than you expected. You accompany Johan out of the battlefield, and watch the rest of the fight as a spectator. Johan seems even more pumped, shouting more than you expected from the relatively shy guy. All in all, it’s a lot of fun, and you don’t even care which side wins in the end. <</if>> And with the battle done, you change back into your street clothes, and return home. You have a suspicion you won’t be forgetting this day anytime soon. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That sounds cool, let’s do this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan escorts you to their little wardrobe tent, which has a small team helping people get properly dressed. But as you slip in, you see several people in their underwear, changing, and putting absurdly ridiculous costumes. As if undressing so publicly wasn’t enough to make you uncomfortable, your brain is quickly infested by an assortment of images of people pointing and laughing at you in costume, and your temperature drops immediately with a panic attack.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, you know what, I just remembered, I double-parked my unicorn, I really need to get going before I get a ticket…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> And with dizzying speed, you skedaddle from the LARPing event, leaving a very confused Johan… I mean JO-HAN THE MAGNIFICENT, behind. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> </span>`

        content: `It’s so hot today, you decide to have that bottle of imported melon soda you’ve been saving for a special occasion. You crack the bottle open, and thirstily drink its contents in instants.<br><br> That REALLY hits the spot. But there’s still some delicious drops inside the bottle… you remember that your tongue has gotten pretty long, and a lightbulb flashes over your head! You bring the bottle to your lips, and proceed to clean its interior with your snake-like appendage.<br><br> Aaaaaaah, you delight in every drop you salvage from the container, sighing happily… that is, until you come to the realization that you can’t quite pull your tongue out - it’s completely stuck to the bottle! Fuck!<br><br> You panic! Can you break the bottle open? No, you’d probably get shards of glass all over your tongue - and that would hurt! You pull the bottle away, but it just slips from your hands and hurts your tongue with the motion. You try pouring some water to make it more slippery… but that just results in a heavier bottle. You turn it upside down to let the liquid out, but all you accomplish is getting your face wet.<br><br> OK, this is getting out of hand. You need a better brain on the job - someone who is used with handling fragile things and good coordination from assembling tiny stuff… Yup, it’s Johan time!<br><br> Knocking furiously at the door, you wait longer than usual for an answer. You hear a muffled cry, and a minute later Johan comes out in a rush, still dripping wet with a towel on his waist.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Sorry, I was in the shower… are you OK, <<print $playerFirstName>>?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"MMMMMMMMHHHHMMM RMMMMLMMMMMM NNHMMMMLLMNNNN!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"WHAT?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You frustratedly point towards your tongue and its attached vessel. Johan, not having his glasses on, squints… until he notices what is going on. He grabs his glasses, and confirms his suspicions.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Let me get this straight - you got your tongue stuck to this bottle… and you want help getting it off?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"YETHHH!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> A still semi-naked Johan scratches his chin as he observes the bottle and your tongue.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"May I… huh… touch it? Your tongue, I mean?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You nod in agreement. He grabs the bottle gently, and pinches your tongue tentatively with the clinical cold analysis of a doctor. He lets out a long “Hmmmmmmmm…” as he studies the situation and rubs his finger against your tongue, trying to get a better understanding of its texture, firmness and whatever else he’s trying to calculate.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I will assume you already tried relaxing your tongue and pulling?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Again, you nod, this time more nervously and frustrated.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"And breaking the glass seems like an idea. I do have a cutter, but I could only safely do it below the neck, which wouldn’t be much help other than making it a little less cumbersome. I think we’ll have to rely on the old lubrication route, I’m afraid."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You sigh, as he goes to the kitchen and comes back with a stick of butter.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"On the bright side, this is pretty tasty butter. But I suppose just licking it plain can be a little… I dunno… but you are about to find out, I guess!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You sit down, and Johan starts buttering up your tongue along the opening. The heat from your body melts the butter, which coats the inside of the bottle. Satisfied with the lubrication, Johan asks for permission to pull. You stead yourself with your hands on the chair, leaning your back away from him as he pulls…<br><br> Ouch, this hurts a bit… but you can feel it slipping…<br><br> Johan pulls harder and harder, and the pain intensifies. You close your eyes, trying to relax your tongue as much as you can…<br><br> Until Johan pulls the bottle off with a loud “POP!”, and tumbles backwards onto the ground, bottle in hand… and towel off his waist.<br><br> It takes a moment for him to recover from the scare. He shakes his head, and celebrates raising the bottle… until he realizes that he is stark naked! He covers his crotch with the bottle, and blushes a deep, dark tone of red. With your tongue now free, you retract it back, still a bit sore, and laugh at Johan.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Ahhhh! OOPS!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He grabs the towel and covers himself, before running back to his room to change. You keep moving your tense jaw, still bothered by having to keep it open so long… and decide to give Johan some privacy as you return to your room…<br><br> Though you can’t quite forget what you saw there for a moment. He left very little to the imagination… and frankly… you are left pretty impressed. Good for you, Johan.`

He seems slightly flustered by the ease with which you manhandle him, but you can’t quite point out if he was scared, aroused… or both!<br><br><<else>>He steps down from the stool, once again bringing attention to the height deficit he now holds against you.<</if>><<if $breasts >= 50>>He looks up, and realizes that he can barely see your face from this close, as your considerable bosom acts as a barrier on top of his head. He takes a step back to look at your face properly.<br><br><<else>>He looks up, getting almost a bit of vertigo as he realizes his eyes barely clear your breasts, forcing him to tilt his chin up to look you in the face. It’s definitely very intimidating so close, so he takes a step back to get a better look at you.<br><br><</if>> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"So… wow, I guess I should deputize you to help change light bulbs and help me clean the drapes, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You get a little lost inside your head. Your height was part of your identity - you’ve ALWAYS been “the short girl” in school, which came with its own set of challenges (like always getting picked last for basketball teams). But now… you tower over most people, your new height redefining who you are… and how others see you. It’s not that there isn’t something a bit exciting about it - it’s just that it creates this bizarre cognitive dissonance, as you still commonly picture yourself with your old stature.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, haha! I suppose I could help you with those things, that’s what tall friends are for, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan gets all flustered, and starts gesticulating wildly with a nervous expression, babbling incoherently as he realizes that his “joke” might have been a bit reductive.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, no! I… just kidding! Your… height… you tall and… I didn’t mean to, just… haha! Not that it isn’t nice to have someone like that, but obviously that’s not what I wanted or expected…"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan, it’s OK, I get it. Trust me, it’s also weird for me too, and I’m still getting used to it."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Not gonna lie, I still feel like that sidekick seeing their old friend getting superpowers and being the one that is all excited… the height does look REALLY good on your figure…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>That one comment surprises you, and you end checking yourself out on his (rather small) bathroom mirror from afar… and he isn’t wrong - the added stature does somehow make you look quite nice - “Look at those legs”, you think to yourself, as you make a bit of a seductive pose by spreading your legs a bit and curving your torso while pucker your lips.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Awamawaaaanaaa…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan has turned beet red, and can’t take his eyes away from your enticing figure. You stand back up, and his eyes track your face as you straighten yourself. Looking back at him, it also somewhat impacts you that the way you see Johan has also changed - he originally was like a cool older brother… and now feels kinda like the cute younger brother, and you find yourself having to resist the urge to just grab and hold him like a little baby.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I assume you still have more stuff to dust, anything hard to reach that you need help with?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan stutters and stammers, and settles for just shaking his head. So you say your goodbyes and wave, as you head to the door. But you can’t help but feel like you have awakened something in him - and hope that this doesn’t get in the way of your friendship… right?`

          content: `As you approach Johan’s apartment, you are shocked to step on something unusual - your feet slosh on the carpeting in the hallway. There’s… water coming out from his front door?<br><br>
               You come in without knocking, asking if everything is alright. You find poor Johan tying towels around a broken pipe that has some badly applied duct tape, but still seems to leak, creating a large puddle that slowly seeps out of the apartment. He is visibly shook, with a level of worry that you did not think he was capable of achieving.<br><br>
               <<if $muscle >= 35 || $height >= 175>>Given your taller stature and strength, you gently ask him to move so you can take a stab at the leak. <<if $carefreeCarefull > 1>>You ask about the main valve, and he explains that this old building has it shared among different apartments, so he can’t shut it off without cutting water to other people. To release some of the pressure, you open the shower and untie the towels, carefully reapplying the duct tape, which holds much better now. You twist the towel a little, and then return it to the pipe much tighter, and pretty much staves most of the leak - nothing a bucket can’t hold for the time being.<br><br>
               <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Wow, thanks <<print $playerFirstName>>, you are a life-saver!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               <<else>>
               You come in hot, trying to squeeze things tighter, but it doesn’t get much better. In fact, you pull it so tight you might have cracked the pipe a bit more. You add another towel and try to stave it, somewhat succeeding, but it’s still a mess.
               <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, it was worth a try!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               <</if>>
               <<else>>
               You look at the mess, and ask if there’s anything you can do to help. Johan asks you to pass him another towel, which from the top of his stool he tries to wrap around the previous one. The flow of water is slightly diminished, but not enough to keep this from being pretty disastrous. He sighs, exasperated, and your heart sinks a bit, seeing him so nervous and sad.
               <</if>>
               <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What happened?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"This pipe had a small crack for a while. I kept asking the super to have a look at it, but he just told me to put some duct tape on it, and place a bucket under the leak. Which I did. But I think it’s been getting worse, and then I find THIS!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What are you going to do?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               He sighs again, and you can feel the tension from a distance.<br><br>
               <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"There’s only so much I can do, I tried looking at some videos online, but even if I had the skills, I don’t have the tools. I’ll end up having to call a plumber, but that’s gonna cost me almost two hundred dollars… and I’ll probably also have to pay for the building damages with all this water everywhere on the floor…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               Feeling for the guy, you dash to your apartment without saying a word, and bring every towel you can collect to try and absorb all the water you can. It’s weird, it’s really not THAT big of a deal, but it’s making you very anxious - the general lack of control, the financial burden that will put on Johan…
               You turn around to see him collecting some of his comics that got wet, and hanging them to dry, and it just pierces your heart. He seems to know what he’s doing and they’ll probably still be readable, just a bit stained. You know how those are important to him, but he still prioritized trying to keep the damage to the building to a minimum.<br><br>
               You bite your lips and frown, and come to help him.<br><br>
               <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Can I help? I can separate these pages while you hang them."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
               <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Thanks, I’m hoping I’ll have the funds to have the plumber come in by the next week… or the one after that, at least. I think I can keep things somewhat under control until then, I guess?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                               You grab a wad of 300 dollars and hand it to him, while you call a plumber on your phone to come urgently.<br><br>

                               Johan stops arguing, lowering his head. He mumbles a thank you, and gives you a big hug. Awwww, the little guy is so adorable!<br><br>
                               <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Plumber should be here in half an hour. We should be able to keep the damage to a minimum if we work together in the meantime."<</Dialogue>><br><br>

                               Little by little, Johan’s spirits are lifted, and he gets back to his usual mood, and by the time you notice, he’s doing little dances as he mops. It brings a smile to your face, and you swear to yourself never to let him down in the future, no matter what.

                           The super grunts and grabs his phone to call for a plumber. You smile proudly, and Johan is still frozen in the same spot. With a giggle, you watch the little soap opera unfold in front of you, but it looks like it will all be under control.<br><br>

            After clanging his pastel-colored dumbbell on the floor against its twin, he starts doing the most haphazard jumping jacks you’ve ever seen. He hasn’t noticed your presence yet, since he’s facing away from the door.<br><br>

            Like his smile, his excitement is infectious. He is really invested in this. <<if $skills[0].level > 2>>However, you can easily tell his actual knowledge about exercise is… severely lacking, and that’s being generous. He was really swinging those weights that are clearly too light even for his small frame - and the form on his jumping jacks? Yikes! It was almost a miracle he didn’t hurt himself already!

                        Remembering your own journey, you think about how much you struggled with squats. That might be a good one to start with. And so you give him some weights to hold, and start explaining how he’s supposed to bend his knees and move his hips. You rest a hand on the base of his back, and another to guide his knees through the move. It’s awkward, and he has a really hard time setting his center of gravity properly - his hips are all over the place.<br><br>
                        But you try to explain and direct, and after a few reps he mostly seems to get it, but his legs are having quite a hard time pulling off the exercise - his lower body is clearly underdeveloped.<br><br>
                        And that’s when one of his knees just buckles, and he loses his balance. <<if $muscle >= 50>>With your hands still on his back, however, you just easily grab him, as your other arm quickly goes in for the legs, and the poor guy is now in your arms, in his very own… prince carry, I guess? You put him down, completely red in the face, and he can’t even look you in the eyes. You try to play it down, but he’s really embarrassed. <<elseif $muscle >= 40>>With your hand on his back, you can handle his weight - even with the dumbbells - and you push him back up to his feet. Johan lets out a nervous giggle, which is quite endearing. << elseif $muscle >= 30>>The sudden shift of Johan’s weight onto your supporting arm on his back jerks both of you, and you almost lose your footing, but after some shuffling, he drops the weights and the two of you lean against each other and avoid a disastrous fall. But you find your face extremely close to his, noses almost touching... as both of you blush, the laughing starts, and the two of you stand straight. <<else>>Everything happens too fast, and you two tumble down after some stumbling around, with you straddling the boy, hands on either side of his head. He looks you in the eyes, breath bated and eyes wide. Your heart races, and your eyes dart around, as your brain tries to catch up. Times crawls to a stop, and it feels like an eternity until you actually get up, and Johan follows.
                        <</if>> Johan tries to apologize, but you insist it’s not necessary.<br><br>

                        Johan blurts, hand on the back of his neck and eyes avoiding yours.<br><br>

                        You declare, flexing your right arm. Johan feels a bit discouraged, however.<br><br>

                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Yeah, but you are awesome and I just suck! If anything, I’m just gonna hold you back... or worse, you’ll lose all respect you have for me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You tilt your head and frown. Silly boy!<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You think I hang out with you because of your physique? I mean, no offense, but it’s not the reason I keep showing up here. I come here because you are a fun, loyal and cool dude!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Pouting, he just looks at you adoringly like a puppy. You roll your eyes and sigh.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, just promise me you won’t hold your self-esteem to what you believe I think of you. I think you are cool, and it’s not your muscles that are going to change that, OK?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        With a smile and teary eyes, Johan nods.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"OBVIOUSLY I judge you based on your ability to beat on Super Slap Bros., SO YOU BETTER NOT SLACK THERE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        After freezing for a second, you both start laughing, and he slaps your back playfully. You are glad to have cleared this up - it’s so great to have someone like him around, it would suck if he just thought you looked down at him.<br><br>
                        <<else>>
                        Raising an eyebrow, you sigh, and put an arm over Johan’s shoulder. He seems a bit confused.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, we ought to check some online resources, you clearly need SOME instructions if you are serious about this."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You pick up his laptop and start searching for articles and videos about exercising. Wow, the Internet is FULL of those. Johan watches over your shoulders, half intimidated by the beefy shirtless dudes on the tutorials, half excited with the prospect of getting some beefy PECS and ABS like those someday.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, to start, do you have any specific goals? Lose fat? Gain muscle? Any specific target areas that need work?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Johan just shrugs and makes his ‘I dunno’ face. Yeah, okay. You grab some paper and a pencil and start scribbling some of the suggestions from the sites.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Okay, why don’t we start with something simple? Let’s do some basic stuff, like concentration curls and tricep extensions, you can follow this program here."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You hand in the routine, and prepare to show him the instructional videos. Pulling a chair, you help him set up and lean his elbow against his thigh.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is this the heaviest weights you got?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Yeah, got them on a sale online."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You grab the heaviest one, which is dark blue, and give it a testing curl. <<if $muscle >= 50>>It’s kinda adorable that he thinks this will even challenge him… or maybe you are fooling yourself because of your own strength? You literally cannot tell how much this weight, it’s like a feather.<<elseif $muscle >= 40>>You guess this will have to do, even though it’s pretty much the lightest thing you could conceive one would use for exercise, these wouldn’t even cut it for a warmup for lateral raises...<<elseif $muscle >= 30>>Well, these aren’t half bad, if a bit too light, but maybe for Johan they might do the job? <<else>>OK! These will do!<</if>> You hand the dumbbell to Johan and watch as he starts excitedly curling - for the first set of 15. After a brief pause, he starts over, but the latter half of the second set is making him grimace and sweat starts forming on his forehead.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You can do it, Johan! Come on!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        That brings a smile back to his face, and he starts the last set. He manages to get 10 reps in, and then two kinda wonky ones, but he’s done.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Not bad! You’ll get there, give it some time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Next, you demonstrate how to do triceps extensions. He watches intently, but does it with horrible form. You sigh, and remember the tips from the website, and try to illustrate by doing it yourself.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Here, make sure to keep your upper arm straight and firm… if you do it right, you can feel your triceps hardening, see?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        As you repeat the motion, you put his hand on the back of your upper arm for him to feel the tightening. <<if $muscle >= 50>>He almost chokes as the horseshoe bulges under his fingers, your arm exploding out of nowhere. You laugh, and Johan blushes. <<elseif $muscle >= 35>>Your firm triceps manifest into existence, and Johan’s eyes widen. You can’t help but giggle. <<elseif $muscle >= 25>>You might not be huge, but your workout have been paying off, and your arm hardens under Johan’s fingertips, and he gives it a squeeze and utters a brief and subdued ‘wow.’ It brings a smile to your face.<</if>> But the important part is that he got it, and proceeds to repeat the motion.<br><br>
                        Satisfied with these exercises, you try to give him the pointers and resources for him to look it up, and you hope he can manage the rest by himself.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You got this, dude. Just keep going, and eventually you’ll get there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Johan nods, and seems genuinely excited. Now, you just hope he’s decreased his odds of getting hurt during his routine.<br><br>
                        <</if>>
                        And with that, you say your goodbyes. Hopefully, Johan can take it from here.

                        Johan looks dejected. It’s like a puppy that just got told he’s not cute and is not a good boy. His pout almost hurts to watch. The attire really should have clued you that he was serious about this whole thing.<br><br>

                        Now THAT’S the unflinchable Johan you know - nothing will bring this guy down. You slap him on the back and tell him that this is the spirit. He does a tentative biceps flex and squeezes his upper arm, almost laughing at himself.<br><br>

                        With his morale raised, you consider your job done, and say your goodbyes. But as you leave, you can’t help but fantasize a bit about a buff Johan. Hmmmmm...

         content: `You walk into Johan’s apartment and find him leaning over his desk, pencil in hand. He seems unusually concentrated on the task at hand, without music blaring or three different Japanese cartoons on the background (the norm for when he isn’t playing videogames, when it’s just one). You approach silently from behind, and you see him drawing something, with several reference pictures of well-muscled females in furry bikinis around his workspace.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Whatchu up to, Johan?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            He gives a small jump, but then realizes it’s you and relaxes again.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, sup, <<print $playerFirstName>>! After our conversation about errr... healthy girls... I decided to take a stab at drawing a barbarian! "<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            You peek over his shoulder. He’s got some pretty awesome drawings there - with the two Franks representing some of the best she-beef ever committed to cellulose. How these guys manage to capture women as both powerful and imposing but still supremely sexy and alluring somewhat baffles you.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s the problem, though? You seem a bit troubled."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Johan looks dejected at his sketch, which right now is just a bunch of pencilled circles and rectangles.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Yeah, I kinda suck at anatomy. I have this pose I want to draw, but I can’t find any good references, and whenever I try to set it up, it looks all wonky and stupid."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            He grabs a plastic poseable figure, showing more of less what he wants, and it does look awesome - holding a big sword horizontally behind her head, with the free hand making a “come here” gesture. You can really imagine how cool that drawing would look, but it does seem a bit hard.<br><br>
            <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"If only I had some good reference for it, but where would I find a barbarian around here... or in this age, I should say, heh! Not many Hyperborians around these days!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
            Well, that is some food for thought!<br><br>
            
            <span id="choice">
                <<link "Duh, I’d say you have the perfect model right here!">>

                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, excuse me, am I chopped liver or something?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Johan just tilts his head, confused. You look at him, annoyed, as your wave your hands over your own body, and then bring your arm back in the same sword-holding pose, flexing your biceps for that extra effect. Johan squints, and it take a few seconds until that lightbulb flashes and his eyes bug out.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"WHOA! You could model for me!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"DUUUUUH!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        And with that, Johan is once again in hyper-mode. He rushes off into the closet, leaving you behind slightly confused. He comes out, with something behind his back. He looks slightly embarrassed.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"So, huh, how much are you willing to commit yourself to the arts?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You raise an eyebrow, waiting to see what he has in stock for you. He pulls out a skimpy metal bikini with some detail in fake fur.
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"So this girl had me sculpt her some foam weapons for LARPing, but she couldn’t pay me, but she offered this battle armor she made as a present."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, calling that ‘armor’ is being VERY generous."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        Johan blushes into a shade of light purple, but makes his biggest and sweetest begging smile.<br><br>
                        <<if $shyConfident > 1 && $submissiveDominant > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m going to rock this bikini so hard you might have to get another pencil just to finish the sketch!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You say, as you snatch the two piece set from his hand.
                        <<elseif $shyConfident < 0 && $submissiveDominant < 0>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I don’t know about that - it’s a bit too revealing for my tastes, and doesn’t look all that practical, I’m sure we can find some alternative...!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>But as you look at Johan’s huge begging eyes, you just roll yours and, with a sigh, grab the two piece set to get changed.
                        <<elseif $shyConfident < 0 && $submissiveDominant > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, lil’ buddy, but the metal bikini is where I draw the line. But I’ll go to my apartment and change into a swimsuit for this, OK?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan is a bit deject, but accepts your decision. You go get changed so you can come back for the posing.
                        <<else>>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I suppose, if I’m doing this, might as well go all the way."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You say, as you snatch the two piece set from his hand to get changed.
                        <</if>><br><br>
                        Now properly dressed, Johan points where you should stand in the middle of his room. He opens the windows, and starts to explain the posing. He grabs a foam sword for you to hold. <<if $muscle >45 && $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan, this so-called ‘sword’ is too light, don’t you have something a bit beefier to really get my biceps pumped?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan gulps at your request, and goes to grab a metal rebar from the closet, which he drags with difficulty to you.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ahhhhh, MUCH better, let’s get a pump going before I start!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And so you start curling the rebar repeatedly, getting your arms filled with blood, before you get back to the pose, now showing much more definition. Johan just gulps again.
                        <<elseif $muscle <25>>While it’s not horribly heavy, holding it up for a prolonged time seems like could get tiring, and you ask Johan to do it empty handed. He agrees, and takes it back from you.<</if>><br><br>
                        After he explains the basics of the pose, you stand there and he sits back down. He pulls the pencil up and notches the proportions with thumb, but you can see he is still a bit frustrated - he tries to verbalize some changes to your posture, but he is having a hard time explaining (or maybe you are the one not getting it).<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh, so, errr, would you mind if I, uh..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, um, I just, wanted to fine tune your pose a bit, so - can I, errr… mind if I use my hands to position you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<if $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>I didn’t cultivate this physique so no one could feel these muscles - go ahead, pose me away!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<elseif $shyconfident >-1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, go ahead!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<else>>You blush, trying to come up with an excuse, but you kind of just freeze and let out an “eep,” which Johan mistakes for consent.
                        <</if>><br><br>
                        Johan brings his hands to your hips, now past the shade of purple. You are not even sure he is even breathing. He adjusts your waist, then proceeds to move your thighs, and he gasps as he realizes just how firm they are - but does not say a single word, which is pretty impressive (his face communicates more than enough, though).<br><br>
                        He straightens up, and starts slightly moving your arm back. At first, he is unable to make your elbow budge, putting quite a bit of effort, but then you relax a bit and let him change the position of your arm. He is transfixed with your upper appendages, and you could swear he is even drooling a bit.<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"PERFECT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        And with that snap, he’s back in Johan mode. He rushes to his chair, and starts sketching furiously. You try to make your fiercest expression, <<if $skills[4].level > 3>>and you apparently succeed, because it makes his fire burn even hotter. It helps that your modelling experience makes it so you don’t move a single bit for the entire duration of the drawing.<<else>>but you could use some more modelling experience to properly communicate that. Also, it means you have a harder time holding the pose, but Johan makes the most of it anyway.<</if>>
                        Eventually Johan’s arms shoot up as he shouts “YES!” It would seem he is done, and you relax.<br><br>
                        As you approach, you see his sketch. Wow, this looks AWESOME - you seem so powerful you could eat barbarians for breakfast!<br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That came out amazing, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I couldn’t have done it without you."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Are you kidding me? All I did was model for you. This is mostly on you. And it DOES look amazing."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, just you wait until I’m done coloring this. It will be even more awesome, just you wait!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                        You can’t deny you are kinda anxious to see the final product. But for now, you change back into your own clothes and head back home, having some fantasies about going around the snow with a big sword.
