	Size aside, your breasts are painfully full. Not just uncomfortably full but actively hurting with how much they need release. They look way bigger, a few blue veins are even visible under the skin, with your nipples puffed up. You're quite certain that at this point you are close to bursting.
<<elseif $breastsFullness is "full">>
	Size aside, they feel REALLY full. It isn't quite painful yet, but it'll quickly become just that if you don't empty them. Emptying your tits... that still is a weird thought. How full they are is clearly visible too, as they look much more pronounced than normal.
<<elseif $breastsFullness is "filling">>
	Size aside, the effect of your lactation is getting visible again. Your breasts are noticeably bigger, and more sensitive too. You wonder how long it'll take for them to completely fill up and require milking, though that'll probably take some time.

<<widget "BodyTypeDescription">>

	<<if $bodyType is "skinny">>
Your body is incredibly skinny, with no definition to speak of. Some people say you could be a model with this, but it almost looks unhealthy.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "average">>
Your body is really average, not skinny nor fat. Just average. It doesn't attract much attention, but at least you know you're healthy.	
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thick">>
Your body is amazingly voluptuous, with some nice curves that are sure to attract attention. A bit thick, but still with a small waist, you got some heft in all the right places!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "obese">>
You have an incredibly full-figured body. Some might call it obese, but you just got some extra weight that gives you a nice, rounded figure. And hey, it makes you look damn good!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thin">>
You've got the body of a swimmer, with some nice definition in the right places, and little to no fat. With your abs outlined and even some definition in your shoulders, you certainly look fit!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "athletic">>
You've got the body you would expect from a male fitness model, with big, defined muscles and beautiful curves, a physique that many would kill for! Pumped biceps, good wide shoulders, strong legs, and even the occasional vein running here and there! Your body just screams 'I lift'.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strong">>
Your body looks incredibly strong due to the large muscles on display, giving you a big, strong look! Big muscles, covered with some flab, their added size granting you a powerlifter physique. Not bad!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heavy">>
Your body looks incredibly strong, like an off-season bodybuilder! Both your huge muscles and soft layer of fat make you look incredibly strong. You can't help but be proud whenever you flex your thick arms!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "bodybuilder">>
If you competed in a bodybuilding show, you'd have a good chance of winning. A thick neck, wide shoulders and huge arms make your torso look big and defined. The relatively thin waist is only a bonus, not to speak of the defined 6-pack you got going!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heroic">>
You have the body of a male superhero! Thick arms,legs and a massive barrel-chest just make you look massive. Buying off-the-rack shirts will be impossible, at least ones that fit your torso. And don't forget your massive lower body, these tree-trunks you call legs are impossible to ignore.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strongman">>
You've got the body of a champion weightlifter, with your incredible strength obvious from both your huge muscles and the thick softness you still have. Though your waist might be a lot thicker than your average bodybuilder, the huge girth gives you plenty of support and means you can lift far more than people expect!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "sumowrestler">>
Despite the huge amount of flab on your body, you are still insanely strong, all thanks to the gigantic muscles under there. They might not be at full display, but that doesn't mean you don't know how to use them! With your girth, you sometimes have trouble getting through doors, and let's not ignore the fact your legs are thicker than some people. But under all that flab is amazing strength!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "hulk">>
When you look in the mirror, you see a gigantic body, bloated by gigantic muscles that would make even the biggest superhero look small. Biceps the size of your head, shoulders that wouldn't fit through a door and a torso so muscular you feel like you could stop a cruise missile, thick slabs flanking every side! And hell, you've seen full-grown trees thinner than your legs. And yet, there is not an ounce of fat to be seen, every vein and striation clearly displayed in their full glory.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "gigantic">>
Your body is inhumanly massive, with muscles that shatter every world record. It barely fits in the mirror, or through doors for that matter. But even at a glance, it's clear how gigantic you've become. From your shelf-like pecs to your thundering legs, every part of you screams 'gigantic'.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "monstrous">>
Your body is so incredibly gigantic it's hard to even conceive of your size! Arms as big as a grown man, legs that could shame trees, and a chest that makes seeing your toes a challenge! Beyond that, your gut might be gigantic, but it only adds to your powerful frame. Sure, doors might be a daunting challenge to cross without causing destruction, but with your size and strength, you can just barge through walls.

<<elseif $bodyHairMod >= 8>> Almost all if your body is covered in a thick layer of coarse, <<print $hairColor>> hair. It makes you look very hairy, and anyone could easily stroke it, especially on your stomach and arms.
<<elseif $bodyHairMod >= 6>> A dense layer of body hair covers your skin. Its course and <<print $hairColor>>, covering most of your arms, legs, torso and genitals. It gives you a really wild look!
<<elseif $bodyHairMod >= 4>> An average amount of body hair covers your body. It can look a bit unkempt if you don't maintain it, but it's never too bothersome.
<<elseif $bodyHairMod >= 2>> A thin dusting of body hair covers your body, though it's easily missed. An advantage of this is that you barely have to trim it, should you want to appear clean shaven.

<<if $height <= 150>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are really short! People can just look straight over your head and a almost everything is out of reach. Buying clothes is also a hassle, since sometimes you've got more luck looking in the children's section!

<<elseif $height <= 165>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are pretty short. You are used to being the shortest in the room, or at least one of the shortest. Buying clothes is also a hassle, though most stores will have something your size.

<<elseif $height <= 175>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are pretty average. It brings no issues to your daily life, but no advantages either.

<<elseif $height <= 185>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are pretty tall. You often find yourself having to look down a bit to talk to people, but nothing out of the ordinary. 

<<elseif $height <= 200>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are really tall! Most of the time you're the tallest in the room, and people are forced to look up a bit so they can talk to you. Buying clothes is a hassle, however, since few stores carry size that fit you properly. 

<<elseif $height <= 230>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are incredibly tall! You are always the tallest person in the room and people have to crane their necks to even talk to you! At this height, doorways are a constant risk to your forehead. Buying clothes is also a hassle, since only a few online stores even carry decent sizes for your build. 

<<elseif $height <= 250>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are gigantic! You are always easily the tallest person in the room and people have to take a step back to even talk to you! At this height, doorways are a constant issue, as you are forced to duck in order to cross them. And that is when you can even stand up straight in a room! Buying clothes is a major issue, since very few online stores carry anything that will fit. 

<<elseif $height <= 300>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are gigantic! You might just be the tallest living person, if not the tallest person ever. You are always easily the tallest person in the room, with some other barely reaching your stomach! Being indoors is a massive hassle as you can rarely stand up straight, and you basically have to crawl to get through doors. All your clothing now has to be custom-made to even have a chance of fitting!

<<elseif $height <= 350>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are a true giant! There's no doubt you're the tallest person ever as you tower over everyone, wherever you go. Outside, you are always the center of attention. People want to take pictures of you or just stand in awe of your stature. Some of them don't even reach your hip! Indoors are a massive hassle as you can never stand up straight, and you basically are forced to crawl through doors. All your clothing now must be custom-made, at unprecedented sizes!

<<elseif $height <= 450>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are a towering giant! Your height is utterly unprecedented, and you are always sure to be the center of attention even at a distance. When you go outside, people stand in awe of you, not sure whether to ask for a picture or hide. At this point, even ordinary "tall" people barely stand taller than your thighs! Being indoors is next to impossible at this juncture, as you can never stand up straight and you have no option but crawl to get through doors. All your clothing now has to be custom-made, and can hardly be recognized as something a person would wear!

<<elseif $height <= 650>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are a taller than some buildings! Your height is utterly unprecedented, and you're always sure to be the center of attention wherever you go... and its adjacent areas. Ordinary people look at you in awe, having to crane their necks to even understand how tall you are. At this point, they barely reach your knees! You can't go inside anymore as you simply won't fit in constructions anymore. Still, being able to tower over buildings is somewhat of a compensation for that...

<<elseif $height <= 1000>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you tower over everything around! You've been told that people even travel from abroad to see you, with only the bravest of them daring to ask you for a picture! Ordinary people are now barely bigger than your head. You could easily hold one in your hand, if you wanted to! With your towering size you do have to be careful though; you wouldn't want to accidentally damage some buildings, right?

<<elseif $height <= 1500>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you're taller than most buildings in town! Whenever you stroll across the town you see the people running and hiding, with only the bravest daring to get closer. Most of them are not even as tall as your fingers! Even your normal footsteps make buildings shake, and you leave footprints wherever you go, but hey, you still have to enjoy a stroll every now and then, right?

<<elseif $height <= 2000>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you're a true giant of legends! People come from all continents to see the 8th wonder of the world that you've become, though barely anyone dares to come too close. They barely come up to your ankles, and considering how much force a single step of your gigantic feet delivers, you kind of understand why they tend to hide. Still, a bit of damage to some property is worth having you around, right?

<<elseif $height <= 5000>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, you are bigger than the protagonists of those cheesy sci-fi movies from the 50s! The entire town has become your playground as most people have either moved away or moved in to gawk at your miraculous height. Nobody even reaches your ankle anymore, yet some of them still approach you, even though your feet could level buildings without you even noticing! After all, it's a bit hard to notice small things like stadiums of that when you are THIS tall.

<<else>>
At <<heighNumeral>> tall, your height no longer makes any sense! You can walk out of the town and not even notice. It feels kind of lonely, actually, as people are no more than ants at this point! Completely detached from your former reality, survival has become somewhat of an issue since your mere nourishment can cause environmental imbalance on a whim. But hey, at least you get a nice massage from lightning when it rains.

This place was clearly built with a purpose in mind. Brick walls and a concrete floor are littered with some small windows at the top, and fluorescent lights humming above.
The large single room that comprises most of the building is lined with rows and rows of weightlifting equipment. Squat cages stand against one wall. A dumbbell rack lines another, ranging from five-pounders to some truly gawk-inducing sizes. Throughout the middle are a variety of benches, weight racks, and many other exercise devices. Among them are leg press machines, pull-up bars, and some angled benches designed for core workouts. The gym is mostly empty at the moment. A small handful of people are working through their own routines, headphones in, minding their own business.

<br><br>
The gym offers several options; you can either get a one-time workout for a set fee, pay for a weekly subscription, or have a protein shake at the bar.

At the bar, you order the ProTein Supplement Deluxe shake™, though you'd be forgiven for thinking someone dumped solid concrete in the cup. Still, they assure you it contains everything you need to optimize your workouts and gains (or GAINZ!!!, as the cup states).

Your <<numeralConversion $tempDick>> long flaccid penis feels pretty hefty to you. If you're not mindful of the clothes you buy, it can result in a pretty clear bulge, though that's not really an issue, right?

Your <<numeralConversion $tempDick>> long flaccid penis looks gigantic on you! No matter the clothing you buy, there will always be a significant bulge that leaves nothing to the imagination.

<<elseif $dick <=35>>
Your <<numeralConversion $tempDick>> long flaccid penis looks more like it belongs on a horse than on you! No matter what you wear, an enormous bulge that leaves nothing to the imagination will be on display, even if you find clothing that can accommodate your considerable meat.

<<elseif $dick <=50>>
Your <<numeralConversion $tempDick>> long flaccid penis easily dangles past your knees! No matter what you wear, that gigantic bulge will leave nothing to the imagination, even if you find clothing that can accommodate your sizeable meat.

<<elseif $dick <=80>>
Your <<numeralConversion $tempDick>> long flaccid penis almost reaches the ground and looks completely inhumane to you! It's useless trying to buy clothing for it now, since it simply won't fit any article you are able to buy.

Though with your girth it might take a little extra work to get it in... some people might actually be concerned at first sight!

Below your dick are two big balls, no other way of putting it. They got some real heft to them, lifting your dick a bit, making your bulge even more noticeable.

Below your dick are gigantic bowling balls, fighting for space. They move and sway with every step, and push your dick out a lot, giving you a ridiculous bulge.

<<elseif $dick + $balls  < 50>>
Below your dick are two monstrous testicles, fighting for space. With every step, they are pushed aside, only to come swinging back. They are covered in veins and constantly shifting. It's downright hypnotic! It is impossible to hide them, and given how sensitive they are...

Below your dick are two monstrous testicles, fighting for space. With every step, they are pushed aside, only to come swinging back.

Clothing fit is determined by its size, but some body features can also make certain pieces with the right size not fit; very big breasts, for example. The icon after the size indicates how it fits you. green is a perfect fit, orange a tight fit, and red means it's either too big or too small.</span>

:: ShoppingCenter [outOfHouse outside mall] {"position":"2300,1525","size":"100,100"}
There is a decent shopping center downtown, with various shops in the old buildings that make up the heart of the city. Restaurants, bars, clothing stores and plenty of other places ensure that you can find almost anything around these parts (or anyone, for that matter). The colorful storefronts are surprisingly welcoming, and since it's a relatively small town, the prices are delightfully modest.

This is Allison's Apparel, one of the few remaining clothing stores here that's not part of a big chain. And that's for the best, because the selection is top-notch, and Allison is always there to help clients herself. Row after row of packed racks make up most of the store, and you get the idea it would take DAYS to browse all that is there. Luckily, everything is neatly organized and labeled, so you should be able to find just about anything you want.

:: UpperBodyDescription [widget] {"position":"3650,425","size":"100,100"}
<<nobr>>
<<widget "upperBodyDescription">>

	<<if $bodyType is "skinny">>
Your body is very lithe, with small shoulders and thin arms connected to a torso that has little in the way of definition or padding. Despite your lack of curves, you still look good, though a little more mass wouldn't be a bad thing. <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "average">>
You have a decent body. Not too big, not too small, not too thin, not too fat. It's just... you. There's little to say about it as you hardly stand out, but you'd like to think you still look decent. <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thick">>
Your body is well shaped, with average arms and shoulders offset by a small but plump tummy, giving you a nice hourglass to your torso. <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "fat">>
From your arms to your waist, it's pretty clear you are overweight. Despite that, you feel superb, and it never seems to trouble you too much! Nice and thick arms, a good padded belly and wide shoulders give you a nice hourglass figure, with curves in all the right places! <<BreastsDescription>> 
	<<elseif $bodyType is "obese">>
You have a very thick body, with thick arms connected to your padded shoulders. Your chest stands out between them, with equal padding on them. <<BreastsDescription>> Below that, you have a hugely sized belly, keeping up with the rest of your body. It's constantly jiggling from the slightest movement on your part. 
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thin">>
Your arms are thin, but they show some good definition. If you started training some, you might get some nice muscles! The same goes for your shoulders, still bony, but with some definition. Hey, if you flex, you almost see abs! <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "athletic">>
Strong, defined arms, wide shoulders, a muscular back and even a hint of a six-pack... yeah, you look strong and athletic! When you gaze at your back, the definition pops out like crazy, with cuts between the muscles and lats that make give you that wide look! And hey, you got some real pecs and actual abs beneath them! <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strong">>
Big boulder shoulders, beefy pecs, thick arms that bulge when you flex, and a midsection that offers plenty of support; you got everything needed to make you look both incredibly big and amazingly strong! When you flex, a few veins rise up, adding that little UMPH! It makes you eager to lift something BIG! <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heavy">>
You look HUGE. Incredibly thick arms, thick waist with a heavy gut and shoulders like boulders. Yet nobody would deny that beneath that thick layer of insulation, you have some incredible muscles that fully support your body... and then some! It makes you look like you could easily lift a giant rock or a small tree. <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "bodybuilder">>
With your huge and defined arms, broad and ripped shoulders, and just a hugely pumped torso, you look ready for a bodybuilding competition! Everything about you screams 'SIZE', from your thick forearms, pumped biceps and triceps to your mountainous shoulders. Even your back is like a map of tectonic plates, all shifting and clashing from the slightest movement. Meanwhile, your pecs and defined abs are sure to attract even the most distracted of onlookers; <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heroic">>
You look like a superhero - a male one at that! Your arms are thick, but not so vascular as to scare people off. Thick biceps and defined triceps just make you look somewhat unreal. Add the strong shoulders and the barrel chest you've got going, and you could send heroes from comics packing any day of the week!  Combined with your insanely chiseled back, your tight and defined abs... yeah, you are the complete package! <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strongman">>
You are gigantic, no other way around it. Sure, your belly might bulge, but above it rest some pecs that leaves no doubt that you can lift anything you want. Combined with your obscenely broad shoulders and your huge arms, you look unbelievably strong, despite most of your muscles not being visibly defined. <<BreastsDescription>>
	<<elseif $bodyType is "sumowrestler">>
Bloated. That's the best word to describe you. Huge or gigantic might also come to mind. The point is: your girth is incredible, your entire torso is covered in a huge layer of fat, hiding an equally impressive amount of muscles. Whatever you do, the smallest action sends ripples through your body, while your muscles make themselves known under the shifting layers of fat.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "hulk">>
If you appeared in a movie or a comic book, people would say your muscles are over the top. But here you are, so gigantically muscular it borders on the obscene. Your forearms have gigantic ropes of muscles that dance with the slightest shift of your limbs, while your biceps and triceps form upper arms that are beyond fantastic. Thick veins adorn them, almost constantly pumping while all the striations on your sinew are on display. Your shoulders are just as unreal, flanking your head with each of its three groups visibly defined. Combined with your vascular and gigantic neck, your huge traps make it hard to look at any direction besides straight ahead. 

Below that, you have obscene pecs that push out comically from your body. When you flex them, they explode outwards, with a thick layer of veins surfacing. <<BreastsDescription>>. Your back is a huge map of valleys and ridges, each muscle fighting for space. Your lats make you impossibly wide, while your abs and obliques give you an almost unbelievable level of definition!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "gigantic">>
You got the body of a strongman, cranked up to eleven. Humongous thick arms with fat that barely covers its gigantic muscles, shoulders that look like you had some beef pumped straight into them, a neck that would make a bull jealous and pecs that hide anything standing too close to you.<<BreastsDescription>>

Your lats push out so much that they flare out at a whim, making your back obscenely wide. Combined with the thick gut you have, it just makes you look enormous, almost monstruous!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "monstrous">>
The combination of almost obscenely large muscles combined with the still thick layer of fat means your body looks nothing short of monstrous. Gigantic arms with thick, rope-like cords of muscle barely hidden, despite the generous layer of fat over them, shoulders that rise and fall from the slightest movement, and a chest that is almost pressed against your chin. Combined with the incredibly thick neck and the traps flanking your head, you almost have trouble turning your head! <<BreastsDescription>>

Your lats push out so much you are forced to rest your arms on them, unable to relax them straight down. Below that, you have a gigantic belly, brick-like abs forcing themselves to the surface despite the thick insulation covering them. It's almost unreal how you manage to be both incredibly muscular and obscenely fat!

<<nobr>>
<<widget "lowerBodyDescription">>

With your <<hipDescription>> hips and <<assDescription>> butt, you have a really nice figure!

<<if $ass + $hips > 12>> And given that your rump is now almost world-famous, it's not surprising that people are stunned when they witness it. Sure, it's almost impossible not to, but do they HAVE to stare at you all the time?!?
<<elseif $ass + $hips > 10>>Since your backside is almost impossible to miss, you have become the center of attention no matter where you go. It'd be nice if people didn't stare now and then, but with a figure like this... eh, can you blame them?
<<elseif $ass + $hips > 8>>Your proverbial trunk is certainly an eye-catcher, making sure people are looking at your back wherever you go.
<<elseif $ass + $hips > 6>>Your ass is a real eye-catcher, and you know it!
<<elseif $ass + $hips > 4>>Sometimes you see people peeking at your behind every now and then, and why shouldn't they? You look good!
<</if>>

Below that, your <<legLenghtDescription>> legs are not the worst either. 

	<<if $bodyType is "skinny">>
They might not be impressive, but they are still shapely, and you'd do well on a catwalk with your lithe appearance!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "average">>
They might be average, but you like to think they've got a nice shape to them. And hey, not everyone needs to be huge or thick!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thick">>
They're voluptuous, contrasting well with your relatively thin waist. Thick, shapely thighs, combined with calves with curves in just the right places give you an amazing silhouette, and you'd be sure to amaze some onlookers!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "fat">>
They're fat, no point in running around the issue. They are covered in a thick layer of flab that still manages to give you some nice curves and a good look. Gotta love them, right?
	<<elseif $bodyType is "obese">>
They're incredibly thick, as they need to support the massive weight of your body. Though they lack definition, they are undeniably huge, flanked on all sides by a thick layer of flab. Still, you can't help but love them!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "thin">>
They're thin but toned, calves and quads exhibiting some nice definition. You can trace the muscles in your legs, the strength and endurance in them clear for all to see. When you move, the muscles dance around, creating quite a show.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "athletic">>
With legs like yours, you could easily dominate any catwalk. Strong and defined muscles, with a bit of softness, give them that defined look that is incredibly hard to get. Every step makes your graceful sinew dance, as quads, calves and hamstrings reshape with every step.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strong">>
They're incredibly strong, just thick cords of muscle hidden behind a small layer of fat that only adds to your incredible bulk. When people see them, they KNOW you are strong. Massive quads bulge, thick diamond-shaped calves support your body, and generous hamstrings tie all together, forming legs that just scream 'powerlifter'.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heavy">>
They're incredibly strong, their strength barely hidden under the supporting layer of fat. Massive quads that rub together constantly, thick calves and massive hamstrings make you the spectacle even more impressive.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "bodybuilder">>
They're hugely muscled, and incredibly defined, easily worthy of any bodybuilding competition! You are blessed with thick wheels of quads that just bulge with power at every step, sharply cut diamond-shaped calves that ooze power, and hamstrings that are so defined they could be used for anatomy lessons! All in all, just enormous!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "heroic">>
They're ready for any superhero pose, as your incredibly large and well-defined legs just scream power. Your thighs rub together constantly with your incredibly large quads and hamstrings, and in your calves you can see all the definition one could desire, granting you an incredibly strong, confident look.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "strongman">>
They're MASSIVE. There is no other word for them, they're just gigantic, with monstrous muscles barely hidden under a layer of fat that fails to properly conceal them. Your thighs rub together constantly, but when you tense your legs, their true strength is revealed as its thick cords surface, proving just how strong you are!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "sumowrestler">>
They're gigantic and bulky, thick layers of fat hiding the massive muscles underneath. But nobody would doubt it, it's obvious just how strong your legs are. They support your massive body, after all, and so much more! Your legs might be fighting for space, but when they are called to lift something, there is no doubt they will succeed!
	<<elseif $bodyType is "hulk">>
They're overflowing with power, every muscle bulging outwards and fighting for space as thick veins compete all over your quads, hamstrings and calves. All the striation and definition is clear for anyone to see, bulging and shifting with every step you take. 
	<<elseif $bodyType is "giganticly bloated">>
Like the rest of you, they're gigantic, bloated and obscenely muscular. Every muscle, from your gigantic quads to your monstrous calves, is fighting for space, making you waddle more so than walk. With every step, the thick cords of muscle shift, carrying your gigantic figure around.
	<<elseif $bodyType is "monstrous">>
Like the rest of you, they look nothing short of restless, monstrous even. They constantly fighting for space as the muscles within can only grow into each other, barely having enough breathing space left to permit you to walk. Every muscle and fiber is patently displayed, constantly bulging and shifting to try and accommodate your gigantic mass.

Getting under the bar to squat, you contract them, the <<getMeasurement "thigh" true>> thighs exploding in size. Pushing the bar up, you feel the weight hit your shoulder and every muscle in your body tenses up, from your <<getMeasurement "calve" true>> calves to your shoulders, all focused to drive that weight UP. You have the feeling you are applying so much force into the ground that it wouldn't be surprising if you left footprints on the floor. With a grunt, you get the weight up. And then down you go, your humongous ass tensing. You complete rep after rep, before finally switching to deadlifts, raising the weight with such intensity that the entire building shakes. You don't even care if the neighbors might be bothered, as you feel the urge to find your limits.
  <<elseif $muscle > 60>>
  	With eager steps, you walk to the weights, loading up the bar and getting ready for squats. As you get under it, you feel the weight on your shoulders, assured that you can do it. Bracing yourself, you revel on your <<getMeasurement "thigh" true>> thighs tensing up, your <<getMeasurement "calve" true>> calves expanding outwards and contracting just to keep your body steady. Pushing up, you grit your teeth, the bar slowly rising and falling to the rhythm of your workout. With each rep, your muscles expand a bit more, push out a bit more, become that bit more defined. You can't stop. Won't stop. The workout reaches insane levels, the floor sometimes shaking from it. Squats, deadlifts, those are just the start. When you are finally done, you can barely walk, but you FEEL bigger!
  <<elseif $muscle > 40>>
  	Plating up the bar, you know you're in for a tough workout. Other people might complain about leg day, but you love it, finally able to prove just what you can do. Getting under the bar, you push up to derack it, and then lowering yourself. In instants, your ass feels like it's on fire. But you push through it, forcing yourself even if it takes every ounce of willpower within. Another rep. And another. Each one makes you feel more pumped, makes you feel stronger. When you're finally done working, out your legs just feel BIG, and they are at least <<getMeasurement "thigh" true>>!
  <<elseif $muscle > 25>>
  	With some hesitation, you plate up the leg press. That's A LOT of weight, but you're sure you can do it. You start, and before you know it, you are into the zone, repeating rep after rep, exercise after exercise. It takes some time before you feel a good pump going, but when it comes, it hits you like lightning! You marvel at your pumped muscles, admiring the work they enable!
  <<else>>
  	Though you try your hardest, the fact is that you just are not strong enough to lift a lot of weight. Nonetheless, you do what you can, dreaming of getting your body to become as big as possible. It's maybe not be much, but it's a start!
  <</if>>
<<elseif _workoutPart is "core">>
  <<if $muscle > 80>>
  	Laying down on the ground, you feel your back press against the cold floor below. You don't care. Your focus is somewhere else. As you tense the tectonic plates that form your abs, you swear you could almost hear the air around it implode, a shockwave coming from your stomach. You start doing simple crunches, though your mobility becomes compromised as your midsection simply bulges out too much with each new rep. You switch to doing planks, keeping your entire body rocksteady, despite the huge effort required to sustain that much mass. Sweat drips off of you onto the floor, but you just grit your teeth and push through. Soon enough, even your massive muscles become exhausted as the pain piles up - but you ignore it, powering through it.
  <<elseif $muscle > 60>>
  	Getting down on the floor, you start another grinding workout: crunches, planks, Russian twists... anything to obliterate your thick abs. It takes a good while to get started, but when you do, it's like a diesel engine in action, just a repetitive ritual of pure power and strength. Soon enough, they feel like they are growing like a spinach-fueled cartoon, their sizable mass defying all odds. By the time you're done, dripping with sweat, you have no doubts you have given your all.
  <<elseif $muscle > 40>>
  	Core workouts are never easy. The exercises look deceptively simple, but require concentration and unbounded willpower. Luckily, you easily manage to find that focus, completing a series of crunches, Russian twists and planks in various cycles to get the most of each. Soon enough, your entire core feels like it's on fire... and yet, you keep going, pushing that little bit more that ensures the workout goes to the next level.
  <<elseif $muscle > 25>>
  	Crunches, planks, Bulgarian splits... it all sounds simple, but over and over they kick your ass, or core, in this case. After a few minutes, the burn starts to get the best of you. And yet, you make sure to get all you can from this routine!
  <<else>>
  	Core. Freaking. Sucks. You can barely maintain form, and after just seconds it hurts more than you can handle, but you push through it and manage to get all you can, little as it may be.
  <</if>>
<<elseif _workoutPart is "arms">>
  <<if $muscle > 80>>
    Picking up the weight, your colossal arms tense up as veins are forced to the surface. Slowly, you start warming up, but your muscles are eager to grow more gigantic still, each rep forcing them to grow bigger, and bigger, and bigger, until your upper arms reach their astonishing <<getMeasurement "upperArm" true>> in size! Even your lower arms look humongous, appearing to be at least <<getMeasurement "lowerArm" true>>! Still, you push through every exercise you know: bicep curls, triceps extensions, switching from biceps to triceps to forearms, squeezing every little bit of mass you can out of this routine. By the time you are done, you finish with a monstrous flex, showing the world just how humongous you have become!
  <<elseif $muscle > 60>>
  	As you begin lifting, your arms quickly get an impressive pump, huge biceps tensing while every bulge in the triceps pushes out for bold contrast. Some veins come to the surface as a testament to your efforts; looking at them, you estimate your arms to be at least <<getMeasurement "upperArm" true>>! Heh, it's a good start, but you know you can still make them grow! With some extra curls, you try to coax a bit more mass out, gritting your teeth throughout the whole ordeal. Sweat pours from you in buckets, your arms screaming for rest. But you don't stop until you can't lift anymore, giving one mighty last flex to show the world who the boss is here!
  <<elseif $muscle > 40>>
  	When you begin lifting, you only need a small warm up before your arms are ready and you can truly get serious. Looking in the mirror, you see them swell up, pumped up from the workouts and just looking plain BIG. Hell, you've seen bodybuilders smaller than you! Mid-workout, you estimate your upper arms to be <<getMeasurement "upperArm" true>> while your forearms measure an impressive <<getMeasurement "lowerArm" true>>. But you know there is more to be had, and you refuse to give up until you get every last bit of effort in. By the time you are done, you can barely stand, your arms hanging by your side in complete exhaustion, but you have no doubts you just had the best session you could manage.
  <<elseif $muscle > 25>>
  	Grabbing the weights confidently, you just get going, and soon you feel a great pump coming. You don't know whether it's all the stuff that has happened recently or just the frustration powering your routine, but as soon as you start lifting, you know you are in the zone. Bicep curls, triceps extensions... you try your best, soon getting your arms to what you estimate to be <<getMeasurement "upperArm" true>>.
  <<else>>
  	Grabbing the weights, you are determined to do your best, little as it may be. You just don't have the muscles to do a respectable workout, your arms measuring a measly <<getMeasurement "upperArm" true>>. Still, you power through all of it, certain you'll get bigger soon enough!
  <</if>>
<<elseif _workoutPart is "back">>
  <<if $muscle > 80>>
  	Shoulders. Trapezius. Lumbar. You know them all, and you know you will feel them all soon enough, slowly starting the workout. Like an old steam train picking up speed, your pace starts slow but grows with inevitable certainty, each workout done picking up more intensity. Whether you're doing rows, shoulder raises or shrugs, there's undeniable intensity in your eyes and your every movement, and you refuse to stop before each and every muscle is pushed to utter exhaustion. The mountains on your back rise, the valleys deepen as a continent of muscles shift and reform with every rep. It sparks a thirst in your soul. You need more. More. MORE. You keep lifting, the building shaking from your movements. Only when all your muscles refuse to get more pumped you become satisfied, certain that this workout will grant you even more mass to your already titanic frame.
  <<elseif $muscle > 60>>
  	Working back and shoulders is always a challenge, given the proportionally smaller muscles there. Heh. Well, they are still huge in your case. It only takes a while before your back turns into a relief map of mountains and valleys, each more pronounced than the last. Shoulder raises, rows, shrugs, you do them all vying for that inevitable pump, delighting in witnessing as your outline becomes bigger and bigger before you. You drain every little bit of effort from the metal in your weights, irrigating them with your hard-earned sweat. You gave it your all, and you're sure this will just drive your body into becoming inevitably bigger and stronger.
  <<elseif $muscle > 40>>
  	The back and shoulders are difficult to train, but you won't take that as an excuse, and soon you forget all about it. It only takes a little while before they feel PUMPED and ready to go! Rows, extensions, shrugs, shoulder raises... you need no break, always eager to start the next one. Soon enough you find yourself tiring into exhaustion, and yet you sneak that extra rep at every chance. Soon enough, you find yourself collapsed on the floor, panting heavily, but smiling as you know you gave it all you got. And then some.
  <<elseif $muscle > 25>>
  	Back and shoulders time. You jump and twist them as you move your neck side to side,  loosening them up a bit before you start. You look forward to a good workout, maybe even a decent pump. Starting with shoulder raises, you find yourself incredibly focused. Before you know it, you feel it: a good pump coming. Rep after rep, exercise after exercise, you might be grinding your teeth and smiling, but deep inside you know it's just a matter of time before you grow even more.
  <<else>>
  	Uuuuurgh. Back and shoulders are the worst. You can barely get the weights up, and it just gets harder from there really fast. But you can get a decent workout going after a while. You're almost too weak to do even the most basic exercises. But you push through the pain, trying to get most out of it.
  <</if>>
<<elseif _workoutPart is "pecs">>
  <<if $muscle > 80>>
    Slowly, you lay down on your back, loving the groaning sound of the metal under you. It brings a smile to your face, knowing you're quickly outgrowing any workout surface available. With an iron grip you hold the bar, feeling the metal squeezed between your fingers, almost like it could give in to the pressure applied. As you start lifting, the huge tectonic plates you have for pecs shift, exploding outwards as if they know the herculean effort needed. The barbell goes up and down, once, twice, three times as your muscles swell up, each lift making them a bit more pumped. Feeling them grow only inspires you to work harder, veins pushing to the surface and sweat pouring out of your forehead. When you start your last set of reps, you can almost swear your muscles will explode, but you give it your best as you roar in defiance, the steel of the bar yielding to your unwavering will. As it rises, you feel unstoppable, each muscle in your body shivering with delight.
  <<elseif $muscle > 60>>
  	As you lay down you can feel the equipment bending. It lets you know just how gigantic you have become, hinting at how utterly pumped you are about to get. As you start lifting, your pecs swell up from the warm-up alone, like they are eager to explore their seemingly infinite potential. Pumping out reps, you get into the zone before you even realize it, your massive pecs towering with each movement. Rep after insane rep they keep at it, pressing weights that would make many a bodybuilder jealous. Gripping the weights harder and harder, you feel the mounting effort in your bones, but with gritted teeth you push through it all, your pecs rising more than they've ever done before. When you finally release the weight, you lay on the bench exhausted and panting, knowing you could not have expected more from yourself.
  <<elseif $muscle > 40>>
  	Laying down on the bench, you decidedly grab the bar, slowly lifting the huge weight. It feels good in your hand, really good. Slowly, the bar goes down, then up. Like the rhythmic beating of a drum, you lift slowly and steadily, each rep inflating your pecs like an imaginary pump. It doesn't take long before you're grinding out uncountable reps, vying to get every last bit of gain from the exercise. When you're finally done, you re-rack the bar, laying on the bench exhausted, but satisfied.
  <<elseif $muscle > 25>>
  	Grabbing the bar, you brace yourself for some serious bench pressing. Soon enough, you are off to the races. The weight you're lifting is not that impressive, but you're decided to do your best, giving it all you got. And so follows a long procession of reps. By the time you are done, you feel exhausted and happy, knowing you pushed yourself. 
  <<else>>
  	Grabbing the bar, you hope to get in the zone, but even with barely any weight loaded, it feels almost too heavy. You push yourself into completing a few reps before your chest is burning from the effort, forcing you to slow down. While you try your best, you just have to face it that it's simply not that much.

<</nobr>>After setting the final box down, you let out a deep sigh. Though everything was now inside, you still have a lot of unpacking to do before you can call this room your own. While it might be barren now, given that it is in the underground basement of your dorm, with some TLC and elbow grease, this has the potential to be a really nice home! You're still extremely happy about being able to move out of your previous dorm, given what happened there. And the rent isn't even too steep; just $<<print $rentAmount>> a week!

What you're less excited about is just how winded you are. It's kinda disappointing how far you've let yourself slip during the last semesters. Maybe this summer break would be a good time to do something about this...

Your train of thought is interrupted by a sudden knock on your door.

You open the door a bit, and the person you see is a dead ringer for the exceedingly energetic voice. Looking at him, you see a textbook victim of early-onset puberty: short, thin, bad posture and an adorable head of messy brown hair. Still, he seems nice enough. 

He continues, barely giving you enough time to react;

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I didn't think there'd be anyone here! Usually no one shows up during the summer, so I was completely surprised when I saw the boxes in the hallway. I take it that they are yours? Anyway, welcome to the building! I'm Johan, everyone here knows me and if you need anything just let me -"<</Dialogue>>

Dear God, that's a lot of energy! He rattles on for a bit, quickly telling you about most of the other tenants and seemingly everyone to ever step in the building since the revolution. After a few sentences, he has lost you completely, but doesn't even notice. After some nodding on your part, he finally realizes that a conversation traditionally requires two participants.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"...And let's not even talk about the mustard incident! Anyway, what's your name?"<</Dialogue>>

<span id="nameChoice"><<textbox "$playerFirstName" "Summer">><<textbox "$playerLastName" "Quinn">><<button "Enter">><<replace "#nameChoice">><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I'm <<print $playerFirstName>>. <<print $playerFirstName>> <<print $playerLastName>>. You said your name is Johan, right?"<</Dialogue>>

You immediately regret handing him the reins of the conversation once again. 

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Yeah, that's me! Captain General Supreme of the local T-T-R-P-G Club, and leader of the local board game night, guilty as charged! Anyway, do you need some help? I'm always willing to help a friend out!"<</Dialogue>>

<span id="genderChoice"><<set $motivation -= 10>>
<<link "Appreciated, but no thanks.">><<set $johanMainQuestQuestion to true>><<replace "#genderChoice">>You quickly reassure him;
<span id="nameChoice">
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don't worry, I can handle this well enough!"<</Dialogue>>
</span>
Johan seems to take the hint, though he's still almost speedrunning this conversation.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, good! I gotta go anyway, I gotta do the... uhm... thing!"<</Dialogue>>

He barely got the last word in before walking away. 

<<link "You could use a small break after this..." "GameIntro3">><</link>><</replace>><</link>>
<<PersonalityCheck $carefreeCarefull <= -1 "Sure, why not?">><<set $johanOpinion += 5>><<replace "#genderChoice">><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, why not?"<</Dialogue>>

You shrug, thinking it's a good way to get to know your neighbor and speeding things up. And what's the worst that can happen by letting a stranger into your house?

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"In that case, I'm more than happy to help!"<</Dialogue>>

Johan immediately moves past you as he obviously tries to just skip the awkwardness he single-handedly prompted. With some instructions, the two of you manage to get an impressive amount of work done within a few hours, and it seems that Johan's enthusiasm is fully present in his work ethic! While he simply can't seem to stop talking, he is also helping quite a bit! After 3 or 4 hours of solid work, you thank him with a beer, which he happily gulps while going over the history of the building.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, it's good to have someone here again. The last guy who lived down here caused an ABSOLUTE mess, but then again, what would you expect from a biological chemistry major who keeps tinkering with crazy experiments at home? There was something about 'supplement peanut butter' winding up in someone's fridge, a bunch of stories about weird side-effects and, before you knew, he is getting booted off campus. Still, listen, thanks for the beer and welcome to the building! Drop by any time! And I mean that literally!"<</Dialogue>>

And with that, he was finally off.

:: GameIntro3 [intro] {"position":"100,1200","size":"100,100"}
Walking towards the fridge for a drink, you continue thinking, making a mental note to put some more work into your social skills to prevent another awkward situation. Walking past a mirror, you catch a quick look at yourself: thin as can be, tiny at <<heighNumeral>> and the only notable feature being your messy hair. Ugh, what a first impression Johan must have had? Though you're tired and your appearance is a mess, you worry that you should try to be more presentable when meeting new people; but that's who you are and you can't really change your bod-


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What the FUCK!?"<</Dialogue>>

The aftertaste of the beverage hits you like a truck, like burned tires drenched in acid. The weird feeling seeps deep into your bones from the inside out, giving you a chill that travels down your body, then up again. After shivering for a split second, and even though you had quite a few large gulps, you just spray whatever is left inside your mouth into the air. A weird blueish-hued mist seems to glow before your very eyes, freaking you out immediately. You bring the slightly dented aluminum can you had in your hand to your eyes: a neat blue label says "G-ACTIV, B102". Great, you've just accidentally drank someone's...  whatever it was that they left there. Strangely enough, you don't feel bad. In fact, now that the shiver has subsided, you feel kind of motivated and energized again, though the nasty aftertaste lingers on your tongue, tingling! After making sure you're not sweating, nauseous or anything, you still need something to wash that out. What should you have?

<span id="choice">
<<link "Some milk">><<replace "#choice">>You <<addBreastsSlow setup.balance.breastAllowancePerDay*1>>quickly down some milk, quickly removing the previous taste. But you do feel a bit woozy.

<h2>Motivation & Exhaustion</h2>
Motivation and exhaustion are the main stats you'll have to balance. Motivation represents your own willingness to complete certain actions, and it must be higher than your Exhaustion to, for example, work out. It is increased by doing enjoyable things or achieving new goals. 

Exhaustion represents how physically or mentally tired you are. It will steadily rise throughout the day, though certain actions may accelerate this. Sleeping or resting will lower it.

<h2>Time & Locations</h2>
Traveling between locations or engaging in activities takes time. Depending on the day or the time, different activities may be available.

<h2>Working out</h2>
Working out can help build muscles, or increase total stamina. There are daily limits to how much you can improve, however. Some items or supplements can help raise the limit, or impact how much each workout will help you improve.

	While you stream, some people take note of just how tall you are; some ask questions and beg you to show off your height a bit, or ask about your clothes! It's all in good fun, and hey, it draws in some more people!
<<elseif $height <= 250 and $height >= 225>>
	While you stream people in the chat keep talking about your height, asking for measurements, or just admiring how tall you are. It's kinda cute, and it even brings in some more viewers!
<<elseif $height <= 300 and $height >= 250>>
	Your gigantic stature is a topic the chat just won't let go; they want to know about your height, different measurements, where you buy clothes... it dominates the whole session! But it's all in good fun, and it draws in more viewers, even if they ARE a little obsessed.
<<elseif $height >= 300>>

<<elseif $breasts <= 100 and $breasts >= 80>>
	 And immediately the chat goes WILD about your boobs. They're big, true, but they can't talk about anything else, like the horny teenagers most of them are. Words like 'goddess' and 'perfect waifu' are thrown around a lot, but what are you to do about it?
<<elseif $breasts >= 100>>

<<if $muscle <= 60 and $muscle >= 40>>
	 It's not often a female bodybuilder streams, and it shows. People keep asking about your lifting routine, your nutritional habits and more. It's actually a nice surprise!
<<elseif $muscle <= 80 and $muscle >= 60>>
	 Since you're easily the most muscular women on the site, your stream draws a LOT of people in. Though most people coming here because of your size, they are quite nice and supportive. Your mods are busy dealing with the less-than-nice people.
<<elseif $muscle <= 100 and $muscle >= 80>>
	 Your gigantic muscles bring people in droves; some supportive and interested, some crass and insulting, and some more than a little horny. Still, you try to keep the conversation going with the nice ones, and ignore the rest.
<<elseif $muscle >= 100>>
	 Your inhumanely large muscles bring in their own audience of people worshipping them, hating them, or just stunned by them. It's quite nice to see all the reactions and, hey, more views!

Before we start the game, there are some global settings that determine how easy or hard the game is. These can be changed at any time in the 'Settings' menu on the left.
<br><br>

<h2>Game Difficulty</h2>
<br>
Determines the difficulty of the game. This does not determine how fast the player grows, merely the challenge during the game. This determines the price of some clothes, the weekly rent they player must pay, and the price of food.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$difficulty" "sandbox" autocheck>> Sandbox - far more money and items available, it's impossible to get fired from jobs.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$difficulty" "easy" autocheck>> Easy - more money and items available.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$difficulty" "medium" autocheck>> Medium - the game is made to have some challenge balancing money and growth.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$difficulty" "hard" autocheck>>  Hard - the game will make an active attempt to bankrupt you and cause a game over.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Growth speed </h2>
<br>
Determines the general speed at which the main character will grow. This makes the game quicker.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$growthMod" 0.5 autocheck>> Slow
<br>
<<radiobutton "$growthMod" 1 autocheck>> Medium
<br>
<<radiobutton "$growthMod" 1.5 autocheck>>  Fast
<br>
<br>
<h2>Daily amount of potions </h2>
<br>
Determines the amount of potions that will appear in the shop daily.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$dailyConsumableAmount" 1 autocheck>> 1
<br>
<<radiobutton "$dailyConsumableAmount" 2 autocheck>> 2
<br>
<<radiobutton "$dailyConsumableAmount" 3 autocheck>>  3
<br>
<br>
<h2>Muscle growth Style</h2>
<br>
Determines the style of muscle growth. At 'Fantasy' you can expect the protagonist to be the size of a large male bodybuilder by mid-game. At 'Realistic' you can expect her to aim for a Grecian Ideal Physique, resulting in more realistic development.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$muscleGrowthStyle" "Realistic" autocheck>> Realistic
<br>
<<radiobutton "$muscleGrowthStyle" "Fantasy" autocheck>> Fantasy
<br>
<br>
<h2>Add Futa content</h2>
<br>
When this is on, the female protagonist can grow a penis.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$futa" true autocheck>> on
<br>
<<radiobutton "$futa" false autocheck>> off
<br>
<br>
<h2>Add lactation content</h2>
<br>
When this is on, the protagonist can start leaking milk
<br>
<<radiobutton "$lactationSetting" true autocheck>> on
<br>
<<radiobutton "$lactationSetting" false autocheck>> off
<br>
<br>
<h2>Measurement system</h2>
Determines the measurement system used in the game.
<br>
<<radiobutton "$measurementSystem" "imperial" autocheck>> Imperial
<br>
<<radiobutton "$measurementSystem" "metric" autocheck>> Metric
<br><br>

Well, his room is full of posters and figurines of various characters from comics and anime, so it\'s not a big stretch to assume that he enjoys this sort of media. A few days ago, you\'ve asked him about it and after talking your ears off about some movies and cartoons, he invited you to come and watch one with him. Since you had nothing to do today, you accepted his invitation. <br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "I\'m glad you showed up!

After a short while, Johan abruptly stops, probably realizing that he was boring you.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Ah, I shouldn\'t be wasting your time! Please sit down and I\'ll bring some snacks!"<</Dialogue>><br>With that he runs towards the kitchen and starts rummaging through the cabinets. He comes back a few minutes later, with a bowl of popcorn along with some chocolate and a myriad of snacks.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Here you go! Feel free to help yourself to anything here".<</Dialogue>><br>You glance somewhat apprehensively at the food laid out before you. Should you be really helping yourself? Your weight has gone up a little bit and you\'ll have to do something about it. You stare harshly at your stomach and waist, which admittedly have seen better days. Johan gives you a curious look, but judging from the slight amusement in his eyes, he noticed your mental struggle.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "Don\'t worry, you look great! Besides, look at me, I should be the one worrying about gaining weight!"<</Dialogue>><br>He laughs heartily and points towards his not particularly big, but still noticeable potbelly. Knowing him, it\'s caused by not exercising enough and too much sitting indoors, playing games and eating snacks. All in all, you laugh at his joke, which does lift your mood a bit. <br><br>After that, you both sat down to watch the movie. You have to admit that it\'s somewhat understandable why Johan is such a big fan of superhero films, as it was definitely exciting! <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "I\'ve gotta say Johan, that was pretty cool!"<</Dialogue>><br>He beams proudly, and gives you a thumbs up.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">> "I\'m glad you liked it.

Before you manage to squeeze a question in, Johan is off.<<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>You see, there\'s this short story here, Thor and Hercules, two mythical deities, challenge each other in armwrestling...<</Dialogue>><br><br>He flashes the open book towards you, the two humongous superheroes sitting atop a mountain and grappling hands. There\’s a lot of text boxes as the two spend a few panels on a stalemate... until they literally destroy rocky outcropping under then, falling down, but still going at it despite the lack of a surface to lean on.<br><br>Your brain tries to even wrap itself around the ridiculous scenario, but your loquacious pal proves once again to be faster.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>I mean, SERIOUSLY, how epic is that?!?

His eyes are still shimmering, certainly still envisioning himself as one of the gods... you wonder if he\'s picturing himself as Thor or Hercules... and frankly, you feel a bit of pity for him.<br><br>A couple of minutes pass. Any second now...<br><br>All of a sudden, Johan blinks a couple of times and his eyes focus on the two arms on the table. You can hear a very audible gulp as reality suddenly sinks in... and so does your stomach.

You try your hardest not to smile and keep your best poker face.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Alright, why don\'t you count down?<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan has an expression of horror in his face, as he slowly counts down.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Uh...

However, you conjure your best impression of absolute effort, gritting your teeth and frowning, while tightening your grip just enough to give him a taste, but being incredibly careful not to hurt your friend.<<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>HNNNNGH!<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan\'s face is beet red, but you are not about to drop your façade. This bit is going to take quite a lot of effort and finesse, but you think you can pull it off...<br><br>Focusing all effort downwards against the table, without breaking Johan\’s arm or hand, you push with all your might. You can see the table slightly bending and hear a faint creaking... yes... if you just push it that little bit more...<br><br><br>CRACK!<\b><br><br>The table splits in two, and you pretend to be as surprised as you can, jumping back and massaging your biceps.<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Damn, Johan, I didn\'t know you had it in you. I thought I had you there for a second, but you put in quite a fight!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan looks at you, dumbfounded. Did he really fall for your trick? You know he\'s not that dumb... and suddenly...<br><br>Johan just jumps and hugs you, dangling his feet off the ground as you hug him back, still somewhat shocked.

Still, Johan seems to still be quite giddy about the concept - as usual, he seems to be leaning more on the fantasy of this scenario than actual reality.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"You ready? Just say go.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan, still grinning, shouts “GO!” with no warning, and throws his whole body against your arm. With little effort, you look at him wincing and grimacing, adorable like a little puppy throwing himself against an adult mastiff.<br><br>You let your friend tire himself out as you check the nails of your free hand. Damn, would you look at the time? With little fanfare, you slam his hand against the table in a quick but controlled slam, making him fall out of his chair in the process.<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Hey... are you ok?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He is on the ground, eyes closed in shame, grabbing his arm.<<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Yeah. Nothing broken... except maybe for my pride?<</Dialogue>><br><br>You go around the table and help him get up. You cheer him up, tell him he put a good fight, but remind him that he was a bit out of his depth. Dejected, he replies:<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Yup... I should know better that I am no god of thunder. You, on the other hand? Damn, it feels like on your way to becoming a super-heroine if you keep growing at this pace<</Dialogue>><br><br>You blush slightly, and thank him for the compliment. At least he seems excited enough about your friendship not to dwell too hard on his loss. And with that, you take your leave.<<elseif $muscle >= 25>>This ought to be fun. You two rest your elbows on the table - you might not be exactly what people would describe as strong, but Johan really might have somewhat overplayed his hand in this challenge. As you clasp hands, you notice a hint of a vein on your hand, unlike Johan\’s very dainty one. Both of you grin, looking forward to the challenge.<br><br>The two of you agree to a simple three-count, and Johan proceeds to do the honors. As he counts three, both of you do your best to drive each other\'s hand down.<br><br>While it should come as no surprise, your heart starts beating faster and your arms slowly inches toward the table. You can feel your biceps and trapezius tensing with effort, a small bump proudly popping on your upper arm. Instead of focusing on the match, you just watch, mesmerized, at that humble but hard-earned mound. Time slows to a crawl as you smile with pride at your physical accomplishment, and your mind wanders... how big could you possibly get if you put the effort in?<br><br>Still entranced, you just drive Johan\'s hand against the table. He looks disappointed, but not surprised, as he massages his hand.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Well, I should have known better. Still... you seem to be getting pretty strong, <<print $playerFirstName>>.<</Dialogue>><br><br>That comment... you freeze for a bit, a huge smile growing on your face, just like your biceps did just moments ago.

As he counts three, both of you do your best to win.<br><br>It seems like a pretty even match. You struggle a bit and make some progress, but Johan is gritting his teeth and getting red in the face, seemingly putting in even more effort than you. You can\'t help but admire his tenacity, easing up a smidge but still trying to win.<br><br>However, Johan might have overplayed his hand, and all this effort means he just gets completely exhausted soon, and you take the opportunity to drive him down.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Well played! I guess I should know better than to think that I could have beaten you just because you are a girl...<</Dialogue>><br><br>He looks forlorn. You try your best to cheer the little guy up, though.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Well, I\'ve been working out, you know?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You smile, and give a quick, mocking flex while you wink at him and playfully stick your tongue out. There really isn\'t much there, but you could swear you saw a little bump pop on your upper arm.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Johan\" \"Johan\">>Thanks... but that was still pretty pathetic.

You declare, as you bite your lips sensuously. Johan seems shocked at your reaction, which is not what he expected at all.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is this some research for characters for your next tabletop campaign?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
You keep looking at them, and you find yourself surprisingly turned on - the ripped quads, the action poses with swords, the most incredible tits you’ve ever seen… there’s nothing you don’t like in these photorealistic depictions of women at peak physical condition.<br><br>

You look deep into his eyes.<br><br>

Everyone seems to be well armed with… foam weapons of every kind? It’s kind of neat, actually, seeing a bunch of long-eared archers, knights, crazy creatures and everything in between.<br><br> You find yourself a nice place to watch, and lean against a shady tree. As the group finishes their preparations, two opposing armies are assembled, and each go to their side of the field. This looks like it could get pretty epic! As the two armies run towards each other, the clash gets more and more heated, with several duels popping up on all corners of the field.<br><br> You notice one of the sides, the one with the darker-clad participants and more non-human creatures, starting to get an advantage. They are clipping through the other side pretty fast, and participants go down and then leave the area. It’s not looking good for the human side… until…<br><br> You see a blue-robed figure with a long beard take center stage, walking with a slow but determined pace. Suddenly, he raises his staff and starts chanting something - the whole team gets another wind, and their redoubled efforts seem to change the tide of the battle. Now the creature side is losing their momentum and taking heavy losses. In a matter of minutes, the dispute is settled, with the light side victorious. Everyone cheers the robed wizard with the beard. Wait a second… is that…?<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You give him a wave, and he quickly spots you, running toward your tree… and stumbling over his long robes.

I can run you through the basics, and the wardrobe team should have something for you! Come on, it will be fun!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Whoa, this escalated quickly. On one hand, it DID look quite fun but… on the other hand… it IS wearing a bunch of fantasy costumes in a VERY public park…<br><br> <span id="choice"> <<link "Uh, I think spectator is more my speed, but thanks for the invite.">> <<replace "#choice">> You look at the assortment of weirdos in varied costumes and realize that this is not quite your beat.

You bow in respect, and he makes a very serious face as he gets back in character in order to return to the field.<br><br> You spend the next few minutes watching another bout, but this time things don’t go so well for Johan’s team. Still, you cheer excitedly from beginning to end, and help Johan lick his wounds as you two go back to your building. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Yeah, that sounds hella fun, count me in!">> <<replace "#choice">> You could use a little fun and exercise, and this opportunity looks like it could lead to both! You agree, and let Johan escort you to the wardrobe tent at the end of the field.<br><br> You are immediately surprised with the elaborate setup they have, with a small team entirely dedicated to furnishing people. Some of the players are changing into different roles, and undressing right there and then. Wow! You start looking around at all the options, as a short guy who is running the operation approaches you, and with a quick glance, proclaims he has the PERFECT outfit for you. You wait with baited breath, as he goes and collects all the items for you.<br><br> <<if $muscle >=65>> He brings back a furry pelt and the green paint, along with a GIANT club. Looks like you get to be a big orc. I mean, I suppose you should’ve seen this one coming. You wear the costume proudly, and take the time to properly paint your exposed body parts a very mossy shade of green, impressing yourself with how big and firm your muscles are as you spread the paint. It dawns on you that, being an orc, means you won’t be on Johan’s team.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Damn, this is kind of weird, but you are almost buying into the role-play here, as you just swing your club and send everyone in your path flying - literally. They must be pretending, right? There’s no way you are strong enough to just be tossing people a few <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>meters<<else>>yards<</if>> away, and you are not even really trying that hard. Still, these people must have some serious stunt experience!<br><br> As you go clearing your path, you spot Johan, apparently being targeted because of the way he turned the tides on the last match. Almost everyone is crowding on top of him, and they are coming in aggressively and violently. Something snaps on your head - you forget that he is the enemy, and you just start running towards him, tackling everyone - friend or foe - that stands between you and him.<br><br> As you arrive into the big mess, you just come to a screeching stop, and use your momentum to hit your club against the ground. You can feel earth shaking, and so do the others, as they turn to you and freeze. Still not quite back to your senses, you just find yourself angrily tossing everyone away from Johan as if they were ants, and by the time you are done, you are the last two standing there.<br><br> However, as you look at Johan’s terrified visage, you realize that you are, in fact, his foe. Before you can make any sense of the situation, he silently kneels, and raises his staff horizontally towards you with both hands in an offering. Oh no, did you just screw this whole thing up?!? You feel pretty bad as you turn around, and see everyone still sort of recovering across the entire field - maybe they WEREN’T pretending after all? You left a veritable trail of devastation… you turn around, and just hug Johan, lifting him clear off the ground as you apologize for your stupid LARP faux-pas.<br><br> But then, you are surprised by something else… EVERYONE starts cheering wildly. What?<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"THAT… WAS… EPIC!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You see some of the people who were filming with their phones going nuts - apparently, you are already trending online on social media, and everyone is amazed - if a bit shaken - with your performance. People are describing this as the LARP of the year, no, the decade, NAY, THE CENTURY!<br><br> The crowd invites you over for some mead and celebration, but you realize you are still a bit in shock yourself, and it won’t be easy getting rid of all this green paint, so you say your goodbyes.<br><br> <<elseif $muscle >=45>> He comes back with a skimpy metal armor and a big sword - I guess it’s time for barbarian <<print $playerFirstName>>, huh? Well, at least it’s quick to change, and it REALLY puts your muscles on display.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> You carry your sword proudly… and frankly, that seems to be enough. Your figure is so imposing that most foes just cower as you poke them with your foam sword, quickly dispatching everyone in your way. You spot Johan, who after becoming MVP of the last match seems to be the target of many enemies - but not on your watch! You rush to his defense, and beautifully executes a true ballet of a swordfight, plowing through the enemies with shock and awe.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ll escort you, let’s go take down that general!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan is so stunned (either by your amazing display or sword mastery or your incredible muscular physique, you are not sure which one) that he just follows in silence. No matter - you proceed to clear a path straight into the enemy base, finding their orc general - it’s a big guy, and he DOES look quite intimidating, as he flips his axe around like a veritable martial arts master!<br><br> You are frozen for a second, having found your match… but neither of you were ready for what happened next: Johan points his staff at you, and shouts:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"RIGHTEOUS MIGHT!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are still frozen and confused, but Johan whispers:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"It doubles your height and multiplies your weight by 8 - increasing your Strength +4 and Constitution +2!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look at the orc general with an evil smile, and you flex every muscle in your body! Your opponent freezes and you see terror in his eyes as you feel yourself growing, every muscle tigheting and become bigger and denser! You could almost swear that the ground looks just a little farther away than before as you pull an inclined epic double-biceps pose, holding your sword aloft in the air. The general’s legs are now visibly shaking, as you strike him - he manages to defend with his enormous axe, but it just breaks in half and you hit him in the forehead!<br><br> The poor guy falls to the ground, and you immediately drop your foam sword in shock, going to check on him. He’s a bit shaken, but he guarantees he’s alright… you help him up, and the entire crowd goes wild! You proceed to give them a little show of your muscles, and everyone cheers even louder. You pick Johan up, and set him on your shoulder, thanking him for the boost. Weirdly, he feels absurdly light, almost as if the spell had worked for real. Ha, you wish!<br><br> You join the others for some merriment, and combat stories are traded among the participants. If you knew LARPing was this much fun, you’d have joined the group a long time ago!<br><br> <<elseif $muscle >=30 && $height >=175>> He brings you a sleek elf ranger costume, complete with a big compound bow and quiver. Nice! You are impressed with how snug it is, making you seem even taller - but also putting all your curves on display. You suspect you might be a little distracting among other LARPers, as you head for the battlefield.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> You don’t know what this costume is doing to your brain, but you almost feel like you have superhuman reflexes and speed. You run across the field, grabbing your bow and just mowing through all opponents almost like you had been doing this for centuries. Your strong legs and arms allow you to zip among the combatants with speed and ease, and pack quite a wallop with your bowstring. Hell, if you knew this was so fun, you’d be LARPing years ago!<br><br> You spot Johan in a bit of a bind, though, as he’s being surrounded by a slew of opponents. Not on your watch, though! You rush to his defense, executing a sliding approach, and you just machine gun an entire side of baddies with 5 perfectly - which stuns the others enough to allow Johan to dispatch the remaining forces with relative ease. Now unencumbered by insurmountable odds, he nods silently and the two of you know exactly what to do - you march on towards the enemy commander.<br><br> The two of you come in like a force of nature, in perfect sync mowing all obstacles that stand between you and the main event. As you see the enormous orc general, you look at a tall tree, and at Johan, and with another nod, it’s like you just had a telepathic conversation. You rush towards the tree, climbing it like it was nothing. Standing on a high branch, you dispatch the defense, while Johan prepares his ultimate spell!<br><br> Amazingly, everything goes as planned, and the two of you claim the battle, and the whole team comes to cheer. Without even thinking, you jump from the tall branch as if you really WERE an elf, and have a slight moment of panic as you realize that gravity very much applies to you still. But you land with a loud THUD! The ground shakes… but you just executed a perfect superhero landing without even realizing! The crowd goes wild, and everyone just grabs and starts carrying the two of you, tossing their two heroes up to the skies to celebrate.<br><br> After things calm down a bit, you look at Johan, who seems exceedingly proud of the shared accomplishment. Once again, a nod is all it takes for the two of you to know exactly what the other is thinking. This moment will live on in legends!<br><br> <<elseif $height <= 155>> He comes with a fairly nondescript peasant costume, and you realize that it lacks shoes - did he really just hand you a halfling costume? COME ON, you are NOT that short! You begrudgingly don the outfit, and prepare for battle.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Your toy sword feels about as demeaning as your costume, and you just sort of wing it on the battlefield. On the bright side, no one really cares about taking you on. On the other hand, you really don’t feel like much of an opportunity to do anything worth notice. You kinda just coast through the battle, watching it from inside. Once you spot Johan, though, you decide to come in for support!<br><br> Johan… errr… JO-HAN, the Magnificent, seems to be a pretty balanced character, alternating between support of others and tackling some minor foes. You help take some of the heat off of him, when he spots the commander of your team get surrounded.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"We must assist our leader! Mayhaps thou could gather some allies while I run to support him! Hark, those berserkers!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> It takes a second for you to process ye oldeth English, but once you figure it out, the plan is simple enough. You go enlist the berserkers, and run to Johan and the commander. The heat is on, and a lot of the bigger creatures are gathering around them. You watch as Johan systematically dispatches the weaker foes, and you try to run interference to give the commander some extra time to tackle the bigger threats.<br><br> Then, Johan, or rather, JO-HAN, the Magnificent, unleashes his powerful blinding spell at the perfect moment, giving your team the opportunity to flip the situation completely! With this battalion dispatched, the remaining forces run towards the enemy commander. But you get so excited that a sneaky Tiefling ends up getting the jump on you with a mortal blow.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"NOOOOOOOOO!!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan… or rather, JO-HAN, the Magnificent, comes to your side, holding your pretend-lifeless corpse, almost in tears. You whsiper:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, Johan? I’m a goner, go help the team, you wanna be there for the exciting climax, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"What wretched journey, for one does not beget their destiny from such follies. Must the innocent be the first to fall? NO, I say!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What are you doing?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "JO-HAN, The Magnificent">>"To die, perchance, to dream… these foibles betray my determination, as I cannot leave my most dear companion behind, even if the world may fall!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You open an eye, looking at Johan’s face… he seems to 100% mean every word, with sincere melancholy on his face… you feel a tear welling up on your eye…<br><br> And then the MC toots the horn, to announce the victory of your side, and Johan drops you back on the ground to celebrate. You hit your head, not enough to hurt, but it’s a bit of a shock. You can’t help but giggle as you see Johan running to join in the festivities of your other teammates.<br><br> Ah, never change, Johan. Never change.<br><br> <<else>> You get a simple generic rogue costume… not much to write home about, and you wonder if you should feel offended by it. Still, beggars can’t be choosers, so you change and get ready for the show.<br><br> You get a very quick tutorial about how this works, and before you know it, there’s some master of ceremonies tooting a horn… and everyone around you starts running to the middle of the field! Fuck! You follow them, getting ready to improvise as you go along.<br><br> Using your pitiful foam dagger, you run around sneakily trying to backstab people who are in the middle of other duels. It works fairly well, as you aren’t really calling much attention. You finally spot Johan… errr… JO-HAN, the Magnificent. He seems embroiled in a battle against three goblins, and it isn’t looking good. You run there as fast as you can, and immediately dispatch one of them with a backstab. YES! Now the odds are evened, and each one of you have your own goblin to tackle. JO-HAN has no trouble with his, but you sweat a bit trying to defend yourself from his mace with just the dagger.<br><br> You manage to execute a beautiful rolling tumble as he strikes you, just barely missing his mace as you land behind him, and stab him from behind! He falls to the ground, and you get up and go hug Johan in the excitement of the moment…<br><br> Which turns out to be a pretty stupid mistake, as it leads an incoming necromancer to get both of you in your distraction. Oh, well… at least the time you spent playing was more fun than you expected. You accompany Johan out of the battlefield, and watch the rest of the fight as a spectator. Johan seems even more pumped, shouting more than you expected from the relatively shy guy. All in all, it’s a lot of fun, and you don’t even care which side wins in the end. <</if>> And with the battle done, you change back into your street clothes, and return home. You have a suspicion you won’t be forgetting this day anytime soon. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That sounds cool, let’s do this!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan escorts you to their little wardrobe tent, which has a small team helping people get properly dressed. But as you slip in, you see several people in their underwear, changing, and putting absurdly ridiculous costumes. As if undressing so publicly wasn’t enough to make you uncomfortable, your brain is quickly infested by an assortment of images of people pointing and laughing at you in costume, and your temperature drops immediately with a panic attack.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh, you know what, I just remembered, I double-parked my unicorn, I really need to get going before I get a ticket…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> And with dizzying speed, you skedaddle from the LARPing event, leaving a very confused Johan… I mean JO-HAN THE MAGNIFICENT, behind. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> </span>`

        content: `It’s so hot today, you decide to have that bottle of imported melon soda you’ve been saving for a special occasion. You crack the bottle open, and thirstily drink its contents in instants.<br><br> That REALLY hits the spot. But there’s still some delicious drops inside the bottle… you remember that your tongue has gotten pretty long, and a lightbulb flashes over your head! You bring the bottle to your lips, and proceed to clean its interior with your snake-like appendage.<br><br> Aaaaaaah, you delight in every drop you salvage from the container, sighing happily… that is, until you come to the realization that you can’t quite pull your tongue out - it’s completely stuck to the bottle! Fuck!<br><br> You panic! Can you break the bottle open? No, you’d probably get shards of glass all over your tongue - and that would hurt! You pull the bottle away, but it just slips from your hands and hurts your tongue with the motion. You try pouring some water to make it more slippery… but that just results in a heavier bottle. You turn it upside down to let the liquid out, but all you accomplish is getting your face wet.<br><br> OK, this is getting out of hand. You need a better brain on the job - someone who is used with handling fragile things and good coordination from assembling tiny stuff… Yup, it’s Johan time!<br><br> Knocking furiously at the door, you wait longer than usual for an answer. You hear a muffled cry, and a minute later Johan comes out in a rush, still dripping wet with a towel on his waist.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Sorry, I was in the shower… are you OK, <<print $playerFirstName>>?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"MMMMMMMMHHHHMMM RMMMMLMMMMMM NNHMMMMLLMNNNN!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"WHAT?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You frustratedly point towards your tongue and its attached vessel. Johan, not having his glasses on, squints… until he notices what is going on. He grabs his glasses, and confirms his suspicions.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Let me get this straight - you got your tongue stuck to this bottle… and you want help getting it off?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"YETHHH!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> A still semi-naked Johan scratches his chin as he observes the bottle and your tongue.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"May I… huh… touch it? Your tongue, I mean?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You nod in agreement. He grabs the bottle gently, and pinches your tongue tentatively with the clinical cold analysis of a doctor. He lets out a long “Hmmmmmmmm…” as he studies the situation and rubs his finger against your tongue, trying to get a better understanding of its texture, firmness and whatever else he’s trying to calculate.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I will assume you already tried relaxing your tongue and pulling?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Again, you nod, this time more nervously and frustrated.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"And breaking the glass seems like an idea. I do have a cutter, but I could only safely do it below the neck, which wouldn’t be much help other than making it a little less cumbersome. I think we’ll have to rely on the old lubrication route, I’m afraid."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You sigh, as he goes to the kitchen and comes back with a stick of butter.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"On the bright side, this is pretty tasty butter. But I suppose just licking it plain can be a little… I dunno… but you are about to find out, I guess!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You sit down, and Johan starts buttering up your tongue along the opening. The heat from your body melts the butter, which coats the inside of the bottle. Satisfied with the lubrication, Johan asks for permission to pull. You stead yourself with your hands on the chair, leaning your back away from him as he pulls…<br><br> Ouch, this hurts a bit… but you can feel it slipping…<br><br> Johan pulls harder and harder, and the pain intensifies. You close your eyes, trying to relax your tongue as much as you can…<br><br> Until Johan pulls the bottle off with a loud “POP!”, and tumbles backwards onto the ground, bottle in hand… and towel off his waist.<br><br> It takes a moment for him to recover from the scare. He shakes his head, and celebrates raising the bottle… until he realizes that he is stark naked! He covers his crotch with the bottle, and blushes a deep, dark tone of red. With your tongue now free, you retract it back, still a bit sore, and laugh at Johan.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Ahhhh! OOPS!!!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He grabs the towel and covers himself, before running back to his room to change. You keep moving your tense jaw, still bothered by having to keep it open so long… and decide to give Johan some privacy as you return to your room…<br><br> Though you can’t quite forget what you saw there for a moment. He left very little to the imagination… and frankly… you are left pretty impressed. Good for you, Johan.`

With curiosity taking the better of you, you decide to step in silently, as you hear a very weird roar coming from where you can see a glow.<br><br> You find Johan sitting cross-legged on his sofa, watching a black and white movie of a giant lizard destroying a city full of buildings. He is stuffing his face with popcorn, completely enraptured by the old flick.

His mouth is agape as the prods it, <<if $fat >= 35>>the velvety skin giving in briefly as he hits the big sinewy mass under it, hard as rubber.<<else>>your hard-as-steel sinew at full display, its incredible definition allowing him to see each muscle as if looking at an anatomy chart. <</if>> After some tentative poking, Johan wraps his hand around as much of your arm as his fingers allow, giving a small squeeze, completely dumbstruck.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, Johan, you can do better than that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan squeezes as hard as he can, his fingertips losing a bit of color as he does - you can barely feel any pressure. <<if $carefreeCarefull < -1>>You grit your teeth and find it in yourself to flex a bit harder, giving your arm an extra pump and forcing Johan’s hand to open a bit wider, smiling proudly at him as you see the color draining from his face as well.<</if>><br><br> Johan gulps audibly. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"But… for real… how strong are you? D-did you test your strength?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You watch as his mind seems to start reeling a bit.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I’ve been hitting the weights some, but I’m not sure what you mean."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, you know. Superheroes have all kinds of power levels. You’d be surprised how much time I spent discussing that on message boards about who is stronger than who, and if they can do this or that."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You really doubt you’d be as surprised as he thinks if you actually found out how much time he spends doing that. In fact, you wouldn’t be surprised at all if he told you he does that every night for hours.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I dunno, when heroes get their powers, sometimes they will do all kinds of tests, like lifting heavy furniture, crushing or bending something… or, you know, the true-and-tried stuff, like doing hard exercises like pull-ups and stuff."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <span id="choice"> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Crushing and bending?

You hear some loud clanging. After a bit, he walks out… well… walking is a bit of an overstatement. He is moving sideways slowly like a crab, with his knees bent, cradling a girthy steel rebar taller than himself.<br><br> As he approaches, you look quizzically before asking:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why the hell do you have a steel rebar?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He drops the heavy piece to the ground with a loud clang, catching his breath before answering. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, I wanted to do this gray wizard cosplay, and all the sticks I found around campus sucked. So I figured I could cover and paint something more solid, and asked my uncle who works in construction for a favor. I seriously think he gave me this as a practical joke, though."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90 && $shyConfident > 2>> With no hesitation, you reach for the bar, lifting it one handedly with ease. Johan’s eyes widen as you smirk at him, putting your second hand on the other edge of the bar, never breaking eye contact with him.<br><br> You start applying force on the rebar, your smirk growing as much as the muscles on your back, arms and chest. You can swear you hear Johan’s heartbeats accelerating as his jaw drops. Your silhouette seems to dwarf him even more as the rebar slowly bends 10… 20 degrees… your smile becomes more confident as you pass the 45 degree mark, making all the way to 90, but still going.<br><br> Johan has stopped breathing, but you are not quite done yet. You keep bending as your hands approach each other, the effort becoming harder and harder. But you are not about to give up. You make that extra little effort and contort the bar so both ends are slightly past each other, creating a loop. You give Johan a wink, before placing the rebar around his neck playfully.<br><br> Except you kinda forgot he wasn’t quite as capable as you, and he almost falls to the ground as you grab it back before he hurts himself, holding him by the arm with your other hand. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I guess I really don’t know my own strength after all…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan is quite impressed with your display of strength, but indecisive whether he wants to question you further about your capabilities… or how to display the little memento you just created for him. He starts, unsurprisingly, going off on all the scenes in which superheroes did that in pop culture, and you watch him excitedly talk about special effects and classic comics… his adorkable charm is surprisingly cute. After a while you realize he doesn’t seem to be getting any closer to a point, and decide to return to your apartment before he comes up with a superhero name and uniform for you. <<elseif $muscle >= 90>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained, I guess…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You grab the bar tentatively, downright surprised at how light it feels. You manage to lift it single-handedly, and try to position yourself so to ease the attempt: holding both ends so you can really engage your back and chest in the attempt.<br><br> You take a deep breath and put all your might in the metal bar with your arms. Both of you are taken aback as the piece starts bending, little by little. Johan starts cheering on you, and you just keep going until you looped it completely.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow… I guess I might just have to start looking at superhero job offers online… or maybe construction."<</Dialogue>><br><br> As you look at Johan, he is giddily jumping from one foot to another, with a big smile and bright eyes. He seems pretty excited about the rebar, citing all instances of popular media in which the character did just that, and how he can use that as prop… apparently having forgotten how hard it was for him to carry it.<br><br> He seems lost in thought as he apparently wonders what exactly he will do with his little memento. As he keeps mumbling to himself, you figure your job is done and it’s time to go home, feeling pretty proud of your accomplishment. <<elseif $muscle >= 55>> You look at the piece of metal taunting you on the floor. It’s almost hypnotizing as you get a mental image of yourself in a superhero suit, the bar malleable in your hands. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That… looks a bit intimidating. But hey, why not give it a try?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You reach down and grab the bar with both hands. It feels solid and with some weight to it, but you can handle it easily enough, quite a contrast from Johan’s attempt to carry it. You tentatively move your hands, figuring the best possible grip. This is going to be quite the challenge, but you aren’t about to give up.<br><br> You start pulling the ends down with incredible effort, your back, chest and arms exploding with an incredible pump - which Johan apparently notices, as his eyes dart over your upper body almost ignoring the bar itself.<br><br> And that proves to be a mistake, because soon the piece of metal starts giving in… just a little bit, but it’s enough to give you a head-start. As it slowly bends, you feel fatigue hitting all major muscle groups, but you are too far in to stop now. Your face reddens as you let out a grunt, and it just keeps going. Johan just watches incredulously, his mind refusing to accept your feat.<br><br> The bar finally reaches a 90 degree bend, and you stop with a deep breath. You look at the bar proudly, and Johan reaches out with his hand, slowly feeling the metallic material from the point where it bent and continuing over its corrugated surface…<br><br> But in his shocked surprise, he just keeps going all the way until your fingers make contact. As you two touch, both feel your hearts skipping a beat. As your eyes meet, his hand absent-mindedly continues over your rigid forearm, incredibly pumped from the effort. He continues, feeling your biceps as he slowly makes his way to your equally engorged shoulders. You can see your warm breath leaving your mouth as visible vapor, both your mouths wide open.<br><br> And then Johan shouts: <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"THAT… WAS INCREDIBLE!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are snapped out of your lascivious thoughts, shaking your head and blinking. Johan steps closer to you, as he starts taking imaginary finger measurements of each and every muscle on your body with gusto. He seems lost in thought as he apparently fantasizes about your abilities. Very flustered, you silently just walk out in a hurry, biting your lips as you try not to fantasize yourself about something else. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> You look at the piece of metal taunting you on the floor. It’s almost hypnotizing as you get a mental image of yourself in a superhero suit, the bar malleable in your hands. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… I think this might be going a tad too far?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You confusedly grab both ends of the bar, feeling its considerable weight as you bring it up towards your chest. You try to figure out the best way to go about this, but the task just plain seems impossible. Johan, however, looks at you excitedly, and you’d hate to disappoint the little guy.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m not sure I have much of a chance…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan, however, seems unfazed. He seems to have an epiphany, and brings up a video on his phone of someone bending a bar on their head, by placing a towel between it and the bar. Before you can object, Johan is already handing you a towel.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, it’s the most important item a hitchhiker can carry!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look at him confused, but oblige, and soon you have a similar setup to the person from the video. You can’t help but shake the fact that he looked so much bigger and more defined than you… but… you can’t allow yourself to disappoint Johan without even trying.<br><br> Soon you have the bar above your head, cushioned by the towel. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, pouring 110% of your effort into the task. Your teeth are completely exposed as your face reddens, and every fiber of your muscles bulge. Johan looks at you in awe, as your biceps could pass for one of the heroes from his comics. He starts cheering you on, and it magically feels like… you are getting stronger? You could swear you are growing as your muscles pump, and you get a second wind. Your head hurts, but that pain somehow seems to channel directly into your nerves, making you feel more and more powerful.<br><br> You grit your teeth harder and harder, and they feel like they might just shatter at any second. And yet, you persevere. And put more and more effort as your back and chest seem to be pushed to their very limits. And then past it - and yet, the bar refuses to bend.<br><br> You take a deep breath and let out a guttural shout. Suddenly, the bar just immediately bends 25 degrees before falling to the ground.<br><br> You two watch the bar for a full minute in utter disbelief, until you catch your breath and let out an excited “whoop!” Johan is quick to join in, jumping onto your arms as you spin him around. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Who’s the superhero now?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You are, you are!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You proceed to take a bunch of silly photos, pretending to be hitting Johan on the head with the bar, as if his head was bending it. Many laughs are had, and you eventually decide to go back home. You can’t help but give your flexed biceps a very strong squeeze as you bite your lip and fantasize about how strong you could possibly get. <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I think you might be going a bit crazy, Johan."<</Dialogue>><br><br> But he seems adamant that you try anyway. He even pulls up a video of someone your age doing it… but it’s a guy, and a bodybuilder on top of that. But Johan begs you with his best puppy eyes until you give a resigned sigh and agrees to give it a try.<br><br> You awkwardly put a towel on your head like the guy on the video, and proceed to get the bar… which seems to be as heavy as Johan made it seem - but considerably easier for you to handle than it was for him, given your strength differential.<br><br> Still, we are talking about BENDING STEEL. You place it on top of your head, and with some fear you start exerting pressure against it, unsuccessfully. But you look at Johan, his expectant eyes jumping between the immobile bar and your bulging biceps, and something sparks inside of you. No! This won’t do. And suddenly, you feel a fire growing from your very core. You frown, grit your teeth and just start to put more and more effort into the impossible challenge.<br><br> You can’t tell how much time has passed, but the fire keeps growing, and you just keep giving more and more of yourself. At this point, Johan’s eyes are fixed intently on you, as your whole upper body seems to respond to whatever it is you are invoking.<br><br> You let out a primal scream, and a wave of burning fatigue washes over your entire body. You fall on your knees, dropping the bar. Johan is immediately there to hold your torso, his arms wrapped around you with enormous care. You feel your body cramping pretty bad, and he helps you get up and stretch. He offers to get you a hot towel or an ice pack, but you wave him off saying you are okay.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Ah, I think I have some menthol analgesic rub in the bathroom!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Before you can respond, he’s off. You sit back down, massaging your pained muscles, when you notice something unusual… the tile on the floor has a straight pattern. The bar feel parallel to the tile… and yet, one of the tips is slightly past the division of the tiles?<br><br> Johan rushes back with the tub of medicine, which he haphazardly dabs on his fingers and starts rubbing your tight muscles. He offers you a massage, and you are forced to accept.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Admit it, you offered this medicine just to have an excuse to rub my muscles…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say that in jest, but Johan’s face goes red immediately. You let out a big laugh, and he just looks away as he keeps trying very hard to work out the kinks on your back, his soft hands having a hard time properly massaging your solid posterior.<br><br> Still, after he is done, you go back home, the image of the bar against the tile burned in your mind. You may have to give that another go someday, you think to yourself. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, do you have any steel bars laying around?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say with a laugh, but realize that Johan is looking at you with a mischievous smile. He tells you to wait a moment, and goes into his closet, where you hear some clanging. After a bit, he walks out… well… walking is a bit of an overstatement. He is moving sideways slowly like a crab, with his knees bent, cradling a girthy steel rebar taller than himself.<br><br> As he approaches, you look quizzically before asking:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Why the hell do you have a steel rebar?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He drops the heavy piece to the ground with a loud clang, catching his breath before answering. <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, I wanted to do this gray wizard cosplay, and all the sticks I found around campus sucked.

It’s… a bit intimidating.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, maybe we should start with something a bit more modest, perhaps?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan looks deflated at your attitude, but understands it. He reaches for the rebar once again, but you push him aside gently. When you grab it, you are very surprised at how light it feels on your hands, but say nothing. You put it back in the closet, and the two of you change the subject… but for the rest of the day, the ease with which you lifted that piece of metal eats at the back of your mind like a parasite… <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> <<link "Lifting heavy stuff is what I was made for!">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I certainly feel quite at home lifting heavy stuff.

He stammers a bit as he continues.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, we need a real test. D-do you think… you can lift my refrigerator?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90 && $shyConfident > 2>> You scoff at the idea.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, let’s have at it! Should be child’s play, really.<</Dialogue>><br><br> You announce confidently, as you make your way to his kitchen. You stand in front of the large old appliance, rubbing your hands with excitement. You wrap your large arms around the device with your knees bent… and with a little grunt, lift the entire thing up a foot or two. It’s not easy, but certainly doable. As if to illustrate your point, you bend your knees for squats a few times just to show off before putting it back down.<br><br> Johan stands by your side, completely speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See? Told you so!<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan starts giving little small jumps in place, with the silliest grin ever. He starts spouting superhero stats faster than you can process. You just keep nodding and smiling, thinking that his adorkable charm is surprisingly cute. After a while you realize he doesn’t seem to be getting any closer to a point, and decide to return to your apartment before he comes up with a superhero name and uniform for you. <<elseif $muscle >= 90>> The idea sounds pretty cool, as you imagine yourself like some sort of real-life superhero from one of his comics. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess it doesn’t hurt to try…<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two of you reach the kitchen. You exchange some confused looks, and you take a deep breath as you brace yourself for the herculean task ahead of you. Bending your knees and wrapping your arms around the metal appliance, you close your eyes and… <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"W-wow…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You look down sideways and see the little shadow of the fridge on the ground as you straighten your knees. You can’t believe it, but you did it! This is heavy, but surprisingly manageable. You very slowly and carefully set the fridge down, and realize you are not even THAT winded from it.<br><br> Johan steps closer to you, as he starts taking imaginary finger measurements of each and every muscle on your body with gusto. He seems lost in thought as he apparently fantasizes about your abilities. As he keeps mumbling to himself, you figure your job is done and it’s time to go home. <<elseif $muscle >= 55>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Huh… this seems like a bit of a stretch, but… I guess I COULD try?<</Dialogue>><br><br> You two take solemn paces towards the kitchen, where you watch your goal with reverence. Could you really lift a fridge? It sounds so improbable…<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"D-do you need anything? A minute?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You shake your head with an expression of pure determination. I mean, other than back injury, what do you really have to lose? You bend your knees and wrap your arms around the appliance, taking a deep breath.<br><br> You put all your might, your entire body shaking as you push yourself to your very limit. Gritting your teeth, you feel every muscle getting pumped, but also very fatigued. You start to regret the idea when suddenly…<br><br> There’s a small rumble, and your knees give a jerk as they raise the refrigerator half a foot off the ground. You let out a small scream as your drop the fridge, making the whole apartment shake enough that you are afraid the floor might collapse.<br><br> The two of you stand there, staring with open mouths at the fridge and each other.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"YOU DID IT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I DID IT!<</Dialogue>><br><br> You two start a rowdy discussion about how cool that was, as the neighbors complain and hit walls. But neither of you care… you two feel like a superhero and her sidekick, and nothing is going to take that away from you right now. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, I’m flattered you think so highly of me, Johan, but I think you might be overestimating my strength a bit there.<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan looks at you with puppy eyes and a pout. You know he’ll just start begging if you don’t, so you shrug and, resigned, make your way to the kitchen.<br><br> You stand right next to the refrigerator. Right now, it feels even bigger than you remember. Johan is following right behind you, squealing in anticipation. You take a deep breath and bend your knees, minding your back for the impossible task ahead of you.<br><br> You grit your teeth and grunt, pushing your entire body to its limits. Every muscle burns, and your breathing goes deeper. But you push yourself, harder and harder. You feel like you are crossing limits you didn’t expect to be so high, and you just keep pushing.<br><br> But the nerves eventually subside, as if the whole world freezed around you, no sounds, no feelings - as if the only things in the universe were you and the fridge. Every law of physics is suddenly revoked, just as the mental limitations you impose on yourself. And at that precise moment, you feel your knees lifting <<if $measurementSystem is "imperial">>a quarter of an inch<<else>>half a centimeter<</if>>.<br><br> And then the whole world comes flushing back, and you step back, scared of yourself. You look at your hands, incredulously, as Johan taps you on the back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Hey, at least you tried. Thanks for doing that for me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You are left speechless. Johan is already going on another tangent, so you slowly make your way back to your apartment, still transfixed as you stare into your hands, the realization of your potential sinking in with a mix of fear and excitement. <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, this is a job for MuscleGirl!<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two of you joke as you go to the kitchen, and you play comically as you try with all your strength to move the monolithic appliance.<br><br> Johan cheers on you for a whole minute, half-jokingly and half-seriously, as your face reddens at the futile task. You try as hard as you can until you are out of breath, but the fridge does not budge a single iota. You eventually break into laughter, soon to be joined by Johan as you slip down your knees to the floor.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I guess MuscleGirl’s weakness is fridgetonyte!<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan also falls down to the ground with laughter, as the two of you slap each other’s backs. Once you catch your breath, he starts telling you stories of feats of strength from his comic books, which you listen to with due amusement.<br><br> After a while, you decide to head back home. But a little something on the back of your head still nibbles at you, daydreaming about someday being able to do those feats of strength Johan so excitedly talked about. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> <<link "Exercises? Pick your poison!">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"With pleasure!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Soon, Johan starts listing a ton of famous scenes and montages of superheroes training, and you have a hard time keeping concentrated as he goes on every tangent possible and imaginable. <<if $skills[0].level > 2>>You are immediately familiar with every exercise he mentions, and getting a bit bored - none of them seem like a worthy challenge. <<else>>While you don’t recognize every exercise he brings up, none of them seem to have the appeal to entice you. <</if>> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>“... and he actually did the salmon ladder himself for the show!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Suddenly, your eyes gleam.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What was that just now?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"The Purple Arrow? He’s so cool, though I will admit he had that awkward phase in the comics when they paired him with the Purple Lantern, it was a bit cringe…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, no… what you said he did himself for the show?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>“... Oh, the salmon ladder? It was such an iconic scene, I swear they keep bringing it up so much it’s gotten kind of played out… but still, you can’t deny it’s cool seeing him bring the bar up the rungs."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You find yourself licking your lips, almost salivating at the idea of trying the salmon ladder - you’ve seen people doing in that ninja competition show: holding a bar that catches on latches on both sides, with more and more latches all the way up, forcing you to use your momentum to thrust yourself up, and catch the bar on the next set of latches. It looks extremely challenging physically… But… where would you find one, you mumble to yourself.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Kinda crazy to imagine that the previous tenant here actually built one on the roof, can’t imagine the last time it got used…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Before he can continue, you are dragging him by his sleeve, on your way to the roof.<br><br> The roof is a bit of a mess. There’s pigeon crap everywhere, and a bunch of broken or forgotten equipment. But as promised, there’s a fully working, if a bit hastily assembled, salmon ladder; its bar laying on the floor, forgotten… but not for long.<br><br> Johan is still going on about the scene as you crack your fingers and grab the bar. It isn’t until you actually set the bar up and latch it to the first rung that he snaps out of it.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh… <<print $playerFirstName>>?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Now it’s your turn to forget the world around you: you are 100% focused. There is nothing except for you, the bar you are holding, and that series of latches that go up to the heavens. GAME ON!<br><br> <<if $muscle >= 90>> You brace yourself, doing some perfect-form pull-ups to warm yourself up. Confident, you take a deep breath, and do a quick pull-up while lifting your knees to gain momentum… then it’s like everything is in slow motion as you propel your incredible mass up, and stretch your arms to get the bar caught in the latches of the next rung. Your heartrate shoots up as bar stabilizes itself, and you give an exhilarated laugh! You got this!<br><br> You repeat the process in another tentative step, still cautiously getting the hang of the movement, and again, you climb another rung without issue. At this point, your heart is just racing with the sheer excitement of your own prowess! But you aren’t stopping there. You manage another two rungs the same way… and now you feel completely confident. You just keep propelling yourself up, and it feels like flying. You stop looking at the rungs, just basking in the aerial view of the campus… soaring like a bird. You just keep going up and up and up and up and…<br><br> By the time you notice, you’ve reached the next to last rung. For the first time, you look down, where you see Johan. Wow, whoever built this metal structure… this feels way taller than it should be, with the structure improvised from the scaffolding of a concert stage. You don’t think Johan could even reach your feet if he jumped and stretched his arm. But the adrenaline has taken over, and you feel completely unstoppable. So you warn Johan to step away.<br><br> With complete conviction, you finish the last rung of the ladder, and grin. You propel yourself forward with a small swing, and pull the bar back, unlatching it from the device. You drop it to the side, as you brace yourself…<br><br> With grace, your let your feet take the brunt of the landing impact, bringing one knee and one hand down in a textbook superhero landing. The floor cracks beneath you as it trembles, and Johan loses his balance and falls on his butt behind you. You feel completely invincible.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That… was… UNBELIEVABLE! How did you learn to do that? Can you do it again? I should have recorded it on my phone. It’s just like in the movie where the guy figures out he’s a superhero! And… "<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan just babbles on and on. But you are in another dimension right now. This experience was a revelation, and you start planning about coming here to work out again…<br><br> And then the whole structure starts shaking, and the salmon ladder rumbles and falls apart. I guess it just wasn’t quite ready to handle your mass.<br><br> Johan might be so excited he doesn’t even notice. Not that it matters. You feel like a billion bucks, and decide to go back to your apartment for a much deserved shower. You just hope Johan remembers to go back inside before tomorrow. <<elseif $muscle >= 50>> You assume this is probably harder than it looks. And it looks pretty damn hard as it is. You do a tentative pull up to warm yourself up, getting a feeling for the motion. The cold breeze gives you a shiver, but you are not about to get discouraged.<br><br> You take a deep breath, and jerk yourself up and raise the bar. It barely makes it to the next rung, giving you quite a scare… which is immediately replaced by absolute bliss. You take another deep breath, concentrate… and BOOM! You just managed to do another rung. Suddenly, it dawns on you that you might just make it.<br><br> But then you look up. The makeshift salmon ladder, assembled from welded stage scaffolding, is ridiculously high. You are not so sure you can get so high… but you are still determined to try.<br><br> Again, bracing before each step, you manage to make another two rungs. Your heart rate seems to increase with each success. You look around, getting a magnificent view of the campus from up here. This is so exciting! So you try another rung…<br><br> And the bar latches on one side, but not the other! You try to brace yourself on the scaffolding, but the metal starts creaking and the whole piece starts breaking apart. You manage to slow your descent, but you still fall awkwardly on your ass. Johan, stunned, tries to pull you back, but he can’t budge you <<if $measurementSystem is "imperial">>an inch<<else>>a centimeter<</if>>. You raise your arms and protect both of you from the lose metal pieces - which thankfully are hollow and fairly light, all things considered. Once the chaos is over, Johan is just looking at you, completely flabbergasted.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Did… did you just save me from falling debris? "<</Dialogue>><br><br> His eyes beam with adoration. True, you are pretty sure that, even if those pieces had hit him directly on the head, he would probably get a nasty bump at worst. Still, he is so excited from the experience, it would seem like he actually believes you just saved his life. He gives you a tight hug, and you hug him back.<br><br> Damn, he is such a good hugger. His arms feel good and warm around you, and you kind of wish time would just stop. But it doesn’t, and soon both of you decide there’s not much else to do on the now even messier roof.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Wait until I tell my friends on the message boards what I’ve been through! I’m going to be FAMOUS!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You kind of doubt that, but that doesn’t keep Johan’s enthusiasm from being downright contagious. You head back to your apartment, feeling amazing, even if you didn’t make it all the way up. <<elseif $muscle >= 30>> As you look up the ladder, your enthusiasm feels a lot colder: boy, is this weird metal scaffolding TALL! You can’t even have a good idea of how many rungs there are! But you are not about to back down, nuh-huh.<br><br> You try to get a feel for this, doing a pull-up. You know you can manage a few, but this is like next-level compared to that. Still, you swing a couple of times, still trying to understand the physics of it all. You can only procrastinate so much, though… so you kind of just swing up and do it, without thinking!<br><br> Before you know, you realize you made it! You managed to go up one rung! Your heart is racing, your mouth feels a bit dry. This is all insane! Before you know it, you try again, but this time you mess up, losing your balance and getting the bar stuck on the scaffolding. The whole structure shakes as you fall on your butt.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>! You okay?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You see concern on Johan’s face. This was just a bit of a tumble, but the little guy is legit worried about you, it’s kind of endearing. You smile at him and say: <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, I’m fine. It’s just my pride that is hurt! Haha!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Still, he helps you up, examining you to make sure you are alright. You try to reassure him it was nothing. <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really, don’t worry. I guess I just need some practice. Maybe we’ll try again another day."<</Dialogue>><br><br> As you make your way back to the stairs, the whole device finally gives its final creak and falls apart. Dang! I guess you’ll have to find another place to try that. <<else>> OK, this was definitely a bad idea. You remember that pull-ups are already not your forte, and your experimentation on the bar reveals that your chances are actually pretty slim. You manage to balance a little bit, but whenever you try to get enough momentum, your jerking fails to get you off the first rung. You try again a few times, but eventually the latch breaks, and you fall back on your feet, losing your balance and tripping backwards, falling over Johan. He tries to catch you, but can’t really handle it, and he also falls back on his butt, as you land on his lap.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Thanks for the catch! I guess you are the hero to save me, after all!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Johan blushes and is completely speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Uh… could you get up, please? You’re kinda heavier than you look…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You apologize as you get up and dust yourself. You offer Johan a hand to help him up, but he refuses, keeping his hands over his lap, his face completely red. Oh, well. I guess it’s time to go back in. Pity that you broke the salmon ladder, though, as you kinda feel like you would like to train there again. <</if>> <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> </span>`

Any good electronics store should have those. It’s not guaranteed income but... it might be worth a try, right? You also see an advertisement for one of the fitness stores in town; the bulk barn. The advertisement is't the clearest on what its about, but you think they're looking for some extra help?
<br><br>
Just as you were about to give up, something catches your eyes. A small advertisement for a low-level data entry job in one of the bigger firms in town. Let's see... strict dress code... no experience required! And it pays surprisingly well! You could schedule a job interview, if you are interested!

Arriving at the building you find a typical office space; a tall building with black glass on all sides. It seems the architect wanted to break with the style of the city as much as possible just from how much it stand out from the rest of the city. Adjusting your clothing you get in, trying to be as confident as possible. You're warmly greeted by a receptionist who barely looks at you before being brought to a small offfice, another applicant waiting there in uncomfortable chairs. For a split second it reminds you of a meatgrinder but you supress those thoughts as you wait. Almost half an hour later its finally your turn, a calm but cold voice calling out.

Suddenly Emma cannot hold her giggling any longer. Her fist slams against the desk loudly as tears form on her eyes.

When you arrive at the office and turn on your PC you notice your entire agenda has been cleared. And replaced with a single meeting with Emma. Fuck.

As you enter her office, she welcomes you in, handing you a cup of the GOOD coffee from the personal machine in her office. Patiently, she sits you down, your file in front of her. Despite all these signs, something is off, as she doesn't seem angry at all. But her professional tone does put you on edge.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Please, take a seat Miss <<print $playerLastName>>. You've been with us for... some time now, and I have got to say, we are decently pleased with your performance. There’s always a learning curve, but your deliveries have yet to disappoint."<</Dialogue>>

You sigh with relief, some of the tension dissipating. However, Emma gets up, and sits on her desk. Oh, shit.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"HOWEVER... It cannot have escaped you that your... physique makes working here at the office a larger challenge than... what we are used to. Now, as company policy, we cannot discriminate on appearance, bodily ability or build. And we at Financial Gains and Bulk Orders LLC, we strive to follow that policy to the letter. But, you happen to be a rather... extreme case, and at this point we have to discuss costs and benefits. Miss <<print $playerLastName>>, we are not firing you. However, we would like to settle this amiably. For this reason, we're ready to offer you a settlement; We can terminate your contract immediately, and in return you will be given severance package of $2000.

It was easy for you to get lost in this philosophy, lifting weights being more of a physically demanding activity meant your mind could wander. It was only until you realized that your partner, Elena, had been paying a bit more attention to you. <br><br>She was close by, performing her favorite bench presses in order to get her already massive chest to get more pumped, perhaps double in size.

So perhaps...<br><br>As her eyes fell upon you again, you increase the intensity of your workout, grunting as your body heaves heavy iron back and forth, muscles popping and flexing in almost hypnotic rhythmic motions.

She takes in a deep breath, expanding the meaty slabs upon her torso, and with another nearly mute yet animalistic grunt, she shoots the oversized barbell back upwards with an eruption of vein and striations. Quickly, she reracks her equipment and takes a quick glance at you. <br><br>Your face of approval and satisfaction now elicits a positive response, though her face is flush with red. With the slightest confirming nod from you, the shy girl looks down upon her chest, lets out a long breath, and flexes her pecs as hard as she can.

I need to guarantee all of those are ready today, but I will also need to fill in for Mr. Thompson on the presentation, which I need to make sure is ready before he arrives."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yikes.

However, this really seems above your pay grade, so you figure it’s best to just keep plugging those numbers. But as time passes, the commotion just seems to increase. Eventually, the usual office whispering starts: it would seems like a major client is coming for an important meeting, but Mr. Thompson not only did not finish the report that was supposed to be presented to them, but he is completely absent and no one can get in touch with him. Work started cascading down the ladder, and you can see Emma is running around reassigning tasks on the fly around the office, trying to salvage what could quickly become disastrous for the company.<br><br>You’ve seen Emma handle bigger stuff than this, so you figure there might be more to it. Well, maybe you can help somehow?<br><br><<else>>This looks way above your paygrade, so you just stick to your current task.<br><br> <</if>> However, as the chaos increases, the situation quickly becomes an all-hands-on-deck as people are pulled off their current tasks to help. Apparently, there are several projects running late that need to be handed in today, and Emma will have to take over a presentation Mr. Thompson was supposed to have finished - but he just didn’t show up at work and his whole project was not ready.<br><br>You see Emma running past your desk, uncommonly agitated, and you muster all your courage to interrupt her and volunteer.<br><br><span id="choice"><<PersonalityCheck $carefreeCarefull >= 2 "Let me take over for Mr. Thompson, you handle the late projects.">><<replace "#choice">>As you usually keep up with all current projects, you have a pretty good idea of all that is going on.

Even though I wasn’t part of the team, I know it well enough to pick it up and finish the report. But if you are to micromanage all the other late deliveries, it will be hard for you to stay up-to-date and present it properly. Let me handle the presentation."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma is quite taken aback. You know you are offering to carry a huge burden, like some sort of corporate Atlas. She looks deep in your eyes, as if she could measure your mettle just by gazing into your soul.<<if $shyConfident >= 2>>But you stand tall and unflinching, staring back at her resolutely. She can’t even hide her surprise.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Alright, miss <<print $playerLastName>>. I will leave that to you.

You grab your computer and head to the presentation room. Reaching the shared folder, you find everything Mr. Thompson had already delivered… and it’s not looking great. Your eyes dart around all the confusing data, and you feel a tinge of doubt as you get a proper idea of the size of the mess you got yourself into. But you know how good you are at this, and nothing is going to stand in your way.<br><br>Your fingers deftly fly over the keyboard, tapping furiously as you organize the report, sending the occasional email to members of the team to get clarity on some minor details. Every time you look at the clock, it feels like time has flown much faster than you expected, but you steel yourself and keep focused on the task at hand.<br><br>As you approach your goal, you look at the clock and realize you only have 15 minutes until the presentation. You spend the next 5 minutes going over all the last bits of revision before you go call Emma.<br><br>As you leave the presentation room, your legs are a bit cramped from all the stress - but no time to stretch. You scan around, and it doesn’t take too long to spot Emma’s rather full and imposing silhouette, and you make your way towards her.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Emma. I’m done. There should be enough time to review the presentation before you join me with the client."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma looks back at you, unable to conceal her worry.

I won’t be able to review the presentation… and I won’t be there."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You are taken off-guard.

Go wash your face, and I’ll have the clients meet you in the presentation room. The tall, gray-haired man with a mole on his right cheek is the president, Mr. Clark."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Alright, <<print $playerFirstName>>, it’s not time to panic. You rush to the bathroom, and wash your face as instructed, make sure you are looking your best. Now is the moment of truth. You look in the mirror, and inspect yourself. <<if $shyConfident >= 2>>Somehow, you are surprised - this is not the same small, insecure girl that arrived at this campus not that long ago. You see a grown, confident and experienced woman. You feel like you could take over the world. So let’s go do it!<<else>>Emma trusts you. And this should be enough. You got this.<</if>><br><br>You walk back to the presentation room. You make sure there’s water for everyone, and that the presentation is all queued up. As the clients walk in, you introduce yourself to Mr. Clark, and apologize for Emma’s absence. <<if $muscle >= 80 || $height >= 180>>This presentation might get a little uncomfortable, as the whole delegation seems to have a hard time not staring at your gigantic body. You keep nervously adjusting your clothes, and hope they will actually keep their eyes on the screen for a change. <<elseif $muscle >= 50>>Your physique is probably something businessmen are not quite used to, as you feel somewhat naked with the constant “discreet” (well, that’s what they probably think, at least) stares you keep getting. But you march on, undeterred. <<elseif $muscle >= 35>>One of his underlings, as you give him a handshake, asks you if you work out while he stares at your arm. You give him a nervous smile and nod. <</if>>You proceed through the presentation, explaining just enough to keep it brief, but clear. The client has a few questions, <<if $shyConfident >= 2>>and you have all the answers ready to go, decisively quashing any doubts with precision and confidence.<<elseif $shyConfident >= 0>>and you do your best to answer them, stammering a bit here and there<<else>>making you doubt yourself and freeze. They look at you inquisitively, and you start going over your notes as your heart rate goes through the roof.<</if>>Just then, Emma quietly makes her way into the room. She apologizes for her tardiness, and picks up just in time to finish the meeting. The clients seem very pleased, and thank Emma emphatically as she escorts them to the elevator. Phew! <<if $muscle >= 60>> As they leave, though, you can’t help but overhear one of them comment: “what do they feed their employees here?”<</if>><br><br>As you walk back to your desk, adrenaline still pumping, Emma comes back, looking pleased.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I will let you know, <<print $playerFirstName>>, these are some of our most demanding clients.

Thankfully, your skills allow you to see where you can make the most difference, and you get a hold of the proper stakeholders and send the proper emails so you can make yourself useful.<br><br>It is a gruesome few hours, and everyone is on edge. But as the workday comes to a late close, the team manages to pull a victory by the skin of their teeth. A slightly disheveled Emma gathers everyone at the office.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Hello, everyone. I’d like to say a few words to everyone. Despite the curveball we were handed today, you have performed beautifully. Yes, we made some mistakes that led us to this terrible situation, but I was glad to see everyone coming together to deliver the results we needed. I am proud of every one of you. Hopefully, we won’t have to face another day like today… but if we do, I’d like nothing more than to count on a team like this one."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Everyone cheers, but despite her slightly not-perfect hair, Emma seems like her serious everyday self. Sure, you managed to deliver an inordinate amount of work today, but your great bookkeeping skills might have gotten lost amidst the chaos. Pity.<br><br>As you shut down your computer and start getting ready to go home, Emma stops by your desk, and now that you are up close and personal, you can feel that she has got a slight nervous edge to her. I guess she is human, after all, you muse to yourself, suppressing a giggle.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Miss <<print $playerLastName>>. I looked at the deliveries today.

And a good boss is expected to give proper feedback and encouragement. Not only that, but this could have reflected very poorly on me had things not gone well. So, I’d also like to extend my personal congratulations and gratitude."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You smile and thank Emma, feeling proud of yourself.

Silently, you can see she is weighing her options before replying:<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"This is a lot of responsibility you are taking. There’s no room for errors here. Normally, I would never agree to this, but I am out of options. Miss <<print $playerLastName>>, do not disappoint me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>And with that, she turns around and goes back to her office.<br><br>Right! It’s time to roll up your sleeves and get to work!<<if $shyConfident > 1>>You stand at the front of the room, raise your hands and call everyone’s attention:<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, everyone!

Everyone who doesn’t have a deadline today, wait by the whiteboard and I will assign tasks accordingly. If anyone thinks they are unable to deliver, send me an email immediately."<</Dialogue>><br><br>With a plan hatched, you start distributing everyone a job. Looking at the project management software, you decide to switch some people into tasks they are more efficient at. Whenever there is a moment of respite, you start collaborating as well.<br><br>The rest of the day goes by like a flash. There is barely any time to breath, but you seem to be on track to deliver all the late projects by EOB, or close enough that it shouldn’t be a problem.<<else>>You hastily open the project management software, and your eyes scan every task and resource with robotic precision. A vision starts crystallizing in your mind, as you send email after email to each stakeholder, explaining that Emma tasked you with managing the late projects, and giving directions on how to proceed. You ask the proper questions and try to come up with the most efficient way to deliver everything.<br><br>You go after the project leaders, trying to liaise so that you can get the most out of each team. There’s barely any time to waste, but you think you might just pull this off. It’s a constant struggle, with several minor adjustments being made as the day goes by - but you can’t help but smile every time a task is ticked off the board, and one by one the projects are being completed.<br><br>With less than 30 minutes until EOB, you realize two of the projects are going to require people to work a little late, but you should be able to complete them in an acceptable timeframe.<</if>>Proud of your accomplishment, you send everyone a congratulatory email. Morale seems higher than when you started, and it’s hard not to feel a bit proud. And that’s when you see Emma leaving the presentation room, with what seems to be a group of very satisfied clients. She makes her way to your desk, a mix of curiosity and apprehension in her eyes.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Thank you for holding the fort. How did you fare with the projects?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Five of the seven projects were successfully delivered by EOB.

Which I could not have done without your help. Thank you, <<print $playerFirstName>>.

I can’t really micromanage that much right now, but I’m sure you can find someone who needs extra hands on deck."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You proceed to check all projects, and once you see the one that needs more help, you volunteer with the project leader. After you finish your task, you reevaluate and ask the next project leader, jumping from task to task quickly. The task board quickly starts clearing up, and while not all projects will be done by EOB, it looks like they should be ready before the end of the day.<br><br>As the business day comes to a close, you see Emma leaving the presentation room, for the first time with a slightly-less-than-perfectly-professional look. If she looks like that, you figure she must be utterly exhausted. And yet, as soon as the suit-laden entourage boards the elevator, she turns around and gets back to micromanaging everyone, helping increase productivity.<br><br>It is way past everyone’s time to clock out, but finally every project due is turned in. There’s a big commotion as the last one is finished, and the whole team erupts in celebrations, clapping echoing through the fluorescent-lit office. Emma goes to the front of the room, as she calls everyone’s attention.<br><br><<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"I am very proud of every single one of you. You have not only performed exceptionally under pressure, but displayed a lot of commitment by staying here this late.

Well, it doesn’t matter - she still made your day with her compliment, and you return home feeling very fulfilled.<<else>>You stammer a bit, with a mumbled “thank you”.

As you wait for the attendant to clear the turnstile, you idly look around and something catches your eye: there’s a fairly buff woman doing squats with the most perfect form you’ve ever witnessed. However, it’s not her carefully positioned glutes that call your attention, but her hair. Those short strawberry-blond bangs and that bun look awfully familiar somehow, but you can’t quite place them.<br><br> You make your way to the changing room, where you put your workout leotard on and store your bag in a locker. As you come out, you see that same figure, still facing away from you, on the machine doing calf presses with quite a heavy load. Again, you are slightly mesmerized by the very slow and deliberate motions - most of the gymgoers who set that many plates usually haphazardly repeat the exercises with swinging motions that aren’t very elegant. But this lady just EMANATES focus and discipline. You can’t help but feel a bit jealous.<br><br> As you sit down to perform some concentration curls on a bench, you see the woman finishing her set and grabbing a large bottle, which she shakes before taking a sip. And as you see the lips reaching the plastic nipple of the bottle, you tilt your head and whisper to yourself in surprise.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Emma?<</Dialogue>><br><br> Yes, it is definitely your boss. Though it’s almost alien to you seeing her not in a tailored suit.

Despite its muted colors, the functional outfit is surprisingly immodest when compared to your usual idea of business-comes-first Emma. Instead of her usual formal glasses, she dons what looks to be a pretty expensive pair of sports glasses, fastened to her head suggesting she could use them for more than just lifting weights.<br><br> While you always suspected your boss to be in great shape, actually witnessing her in this is a whole other story. She could easily be used as an anatomy chart, with what could only be described as very deliberate symmetry - all muscle groups equally developed, almost like a work of art.<<if $skills[0].level > 2>>You could easily think she was about to compete in professional bodybuilding, if not for that off-season fluff - a dead-ringer for a bulking cycle (which only reinforces that very obstinate aura of functionality she exudes at all times.)<</if>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Emma?

However, I realize there are some well-documented benefits in having a workout partner.<</Dialogue>><br><br> Did your boss just… invite you to train alongside her?

What are coworkers for, am I right?<</Dialogue>><br><br>You see Emma squinting slightly, giving some thought to your offer before actually replying.<br><br><<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>Well, there certainly aren’t many people here I would trust to handle spotting my lifts….<</Dialogue>><br><br>You look expectantly at her, holding an urge to bite your lip as you low-key start tip-toeing up and down in anticipation. Emma probably catches that, as she responds:<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>You know what… I’ve been trying to reach a new personal best on my bench press. I could use a spotter.<</Dialogue>><br><br>Knowing you are in for a treat, you tailor the rest of your routine around Emma’s plan. While she’s not great at encouragement, you can barely believe the knowledge she holds, giving you tips and pointers at every opportunity. She’s like the perfect, albeit very strict, mentor. She pushes you harder than you have every pushed yourself - but never making you feel bad about it.<br><br>Likewise, watching her perform each exercise is like watching a Greek statue come to life - there’s a mix of beauty, finesse and sheer determination in every movement. If it wasn’t impolite, you’d be recording her with your phone just to watch it over and over.<br><br>In time, she tries to push herself harder, and that’s when you step in to spot. As she lays down for a bench press, you stand above the loaded barbell, ready to help. Her hands grip the bar, her knuckles white from the effort, as the bar slowly but decidedly is lifted up… and down… you keep your hands floating under it, in case she fails. You can hear Emma breathing harder than usual, yet her movement is consistently rocksteady. While you don’t want to look away from the straining metal rod, you steal some glances at your boss’s face: her eyes are laser focused; her expression the ultimate demonstration of pure concentration.<br><br>Yet she perseveres. Her methodical process continues as she cranks rep after rep, her back arching and her chest inflating in what you can only describe as poetry in motion. It takes some effort on your part to keep your mouth closed and not drool at the absolutely inspirational display of raw effort and strength happening mere <<if $measurementSystem == "metric">>centimeters<<else>>inches<</if>> below your nose.<br><br>However, as she starts her tenth rep, you notice something. It’s subtle, but you see her jaw clenching; her upper arms give a very slight wobble. Her upwards movement, unlike every rep prior, is not smooth and controlled. In a split second, your mind races as you realize how hard she had been pushing herself this whole time without letting the universe know. For the first time ever, you feel like she might actually be inching towards what you never suspected she might have - a limit.<br><br>The bar continues to go up in shaky increments, and your instincts are screaming for you to grab the bar and help her on the last rep, but almost as if you shared some sort of bodybuilding mental link, you restrain yourself, merely letting your palms get closer to the bar. Time slows to a crawl, and seconds feel like minutes as Emma continues to slowly work her way up.<br><br>She manages to lift the bar a bit more than halfway through before you have to step in, the added strength of the two of you completing the motion. Carefully, you two rest the bar back on the stand. Emma’s face is inscrutable, and you try to figure out if she’s proud of her new personal best or disappointed that she needed the spot on that last part. Either way, she stands up, rock-faced, and curtly thanks you for your help.<<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Would you mind if I tagged along with you? I certainly could use a few pointers.<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma’s visage remains stone-cold serious, and you momentarily wonder if you overstepped your boundaries. But then she cracks a small smile, and your shoulders relax.<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>It would be an honor. While I have studied a lot to achieve my goals, I could never had achieved these goals without the help of my mentor. The least I can do is reciprocate with someone else.<</Dialogue>><br><br>You can’t quite pinpoint what has changed, but something about Emma’s demeanor is… different? She still carries herself the same way, but as she goes from exercise to exercise, she takes the time to demonstrate the motions, and watches carefully as you repeat them, giving very clear and well explained corrections. She’s less of a boss and more of a professor, the sports glasses a hilarious contrast, making her seem like the world’s strongest librarian. You follow as the Sancho to her Quixote, stacking plates and helping her wipe after herself.<br><br>As the minutes pass, both of you seem to get a bit more laid back. Eventually, Emma starts nonchalantly posing in front of a mirror, admiring her physique as if you had evaporated. You see it in her eyes, the whole universe is gone, there is only her body and those ever-higher goals she sets for herself. You can’t help it, and unironically clap as you praise her:<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Someday… I’ll be like you. Thanks for being such an amazing teacher and inspiration, Emma.<</Dialogue>><br><br>She snaps out of her trance, and you could swear that you saw her briefly blush. But she just gives you a silent nod and proceeds to thank you for the company.<</if>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That was great, Emma.<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>I won’t lie… I didn’t know what I was missing by always training on my own. Maybe someday we could have a stab at a friendly game of squash? God knows I could use some entertainment after some of the more frustrating workdays.<</Dialogue>><br><br>You try to encourage that idea, without seeming overly eager. Playing with her would certainly be a very interesting challenge!<br><br>You wipe yourself on your way to the shower, looking forward for more opportunities to train with your boss.<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>>         <</replace>>     <</link>>     <<link "I don’t want to take any more of your time.

Elena really means it, even with all her determination and effort, there’s a certain… melancholy… in her late-night training. You feel something stir inside of you, wanting so bad to be that person that can share her passion.<br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Lead the way!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>She looks into your eyes, eagerly, and gives a very emphatic head nod, before she turns around and the two of you walk to the respectable selection of barbells in front of the mirror.<br><br><</if>>Elena carefully sets the weights on her barbell, then asks how much weight you usually train with.<br><br><<if $muscle > 80>>You tell her, and she stares surprisedly for a second.

She worries a bit about you getting hurt, but you explain that it’s not THAT much more… and that you are certain she’ll help you reach a new level today.<br><br> <<else>>You tell her, and she loads a lighter barbell for you. Inside, you are telling yourself that someday you’ll be as strong as her…<<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"You are my goal…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You whisper softly to yourself. Elena freezes while setting the fasteners to the barbell… did she hear that…?<br><br><</if>>Ready to start, Elena insists firmly that you go first.<br><br><<if $skills[0].level > 3>>You bend down and grab the weights with perfect form, while Elena stands behind to spot.<<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"Y-your form… //p-perfetta//!!!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You make sure to keep a slow pace, making the most out of the exercise. You could swear you even hear a small gasp coming from your partner as you finish your set with enviable form.<br><br><<else>>You grab the bar and start the set, and Elena steps in briefly, placing her hands on your body to make slight corrections to your form. You try not to get distracted, but her hands feel so good, so gentle…<br><br>Snap out of it, <<print $playerFirstName>>! You continue, making mental notes of Elena’s corrections, trying to be very aware of your body for future workouts.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Molto bene//. You are a quick learner.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><</if>>After you finish, it’s Elena’s turn. You stand behind her as a spotter, and watch her gracefully bend down and pick up the weight. She moves with the grace of a dancer, but the determination of a lion. You watch her perfect form, her gaze intently fixed on the mirror doing the same. She keeps completing rep after rep as if all were the very first, like she doesn’t get tired. You don’t know what true beauty is, but it could very well be this. Despite her size, Elena somehow makes this motion feel almost… poetic. Like a machine that was engineered specifically for aesthetic beauty in its purposeful cycle.<br><br>After she is finished, you are still somewhat stunned.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Bambina//, you are up.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You shake your head awake, and return to the weight. <<if $shyConfident < 0>>You feel a little awkward now, Elena is a tough act to follow. You grab the weight, but now looking self-consciously at the mirror. You start your second set of deadlifts, but you’ve gotten into your head and can’t really concentrate.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"<<print $playerFirstName>>... are you alright?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your form is wobbly and wonky. You try to fix one problem and create another two. Your movements are janky and erratic. And it’s not the load, it’s your head that’s getting in the way.<br><br>Elena comes in behind you gently, and grabs the weight with an underhand grip. Together, the two of you continue, and the feeling of her skin against yours somehow makes your worries melt away. You resume your previous, much improved, form… and all is good in the world. By the time you notice, Elena has already stepped back and you are finishing your set. She claps, congratulating you, and you blush deeply.<<elseif $shyConfident > 1>>You want to impress Elena, and end up adding even more weight to the bar. She questions your decision politely, but you insist. You grab the bar, but now your reps are not nearly as nice as last time, waving and shaking all the way. Elena just steps back, giving you more space, but clearly prepared to step in if something happens.<br><br>After you are done, you realize this was a bad idea, and just remove the excess weight, feeling slightly ashamed.<</if>>Done with your set, it’s Elena’s turn again. She goes for the bar, and it is no surprise that it’s a reprise of the last set: fluid and precise. You admire her every motion and every <<if $measurementSystem == \"metric\">>centimeter<<else>>inch<</if>> of her body… until you look at her through the mirror, and your eyes meet.<br><br>It feels like a spark flying between the two of you, literal electricity running through your spine. And the feeling seems to be mutual, as Elena gasps and her grip loosens, her form shaking from that simple gaze. Faster than your brain can process, you have stepped in behind her, in a hug, grabbing the weight as your bodies meet.<br><br>Elena feels very warm to touch, but also surprisingly soft for someone so muscular. And instead of jerking back at the touch, she just closes her eyes, and resumes the exercise, humming contently.<br><br>You remain there, holding the weight - and her indirectly - as the set comes to completion. You take a silent step back, and she turns around, her usual shy expression slightly melted into… a very warm (but still shy) smile.<<Dialogue \"Elena\" \"Elena\">>\"//Grazie//, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Thank you… for the spot.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"player\" \"You\">>\"Ah, it was nothing…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You lie.<br><br>Each one of you continue for another set, as if nothing had happened. But it did. And you can’t shake the feeling that Elena might just be opening up to you a bit.'

It breaks your heart. So you sit down on the white side, and move a pawn. Elena looks at you very surprised, then smiles broadly as she makes her own move.<br><br> Elena’s game is impressive, if not downright scary. Going against your expectations, she takes almost no time before making her moves, showing zero sign of hesitation. But she has an incredible awareness of the board and seems to be able to look more moves ahead than you could ever dream of. But you sense no competitive urge, no sense of worry, just a background hum of happiness to share this moment with someone.<br><br> In a matter of minutes, she has your queen under checkmate.

Your turn.<</Dialogue>><br><br> You snap out of your trance, and find the board looking almost alien to you. You stammer as your hand hovers a bunch of pieces, and you find yourself making a very stupid move. But as Elena puts her hand to make her move, you confusedly try to grab the piece you just moved for a redo and both of your hands touch.<br><br> <<if $shyConfident < 0>> With a gasp, both of you take your hands back. You apologize, and let her make her original move - which clinches another checkmate for her.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That… was beautiful…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, no… that was just fortuna… luck.<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I didn’t mean the play…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say, as you gaze admiringly into her eyes. And then you realize what you just did, and cover your mouth. Elena, however, doesn’t react shyly this time. She puts her hand on yours, and says with incredible sweetness:<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie…."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<else>> Elena starts to pull her hand back, but you hold it in yours. Yes, her hand is calloused from handling obscene amounts of weight on a daily basis… and yet… it feels so soft. But you can also feel she is shaking a bit, and as you see the anxiety in her eyes, you let go. <</if>> Looking at her phone, Elena realizes what time it is, and gets up in a hurry.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"È tardi… I should go…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> She grabs her belongings and starts walking off, but she turns to you one last time.<br><br> <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"We should do this again. If… you don’t mind, certo?<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It would be my honor…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You say, as you watch her enormous silhouette walk away through the flower garden with dainty steps, holding her purse on her elbow with the forearm pointing up.

        content: `You watch your form as you perform some truly challenging hero curls, admiring your arms, while you notice a couple of dudes hunched over their phones, snort and laughing at the corner. You’ve actually been quite amused by some gym memes you saw at your apartment earlier, and figure you might join in on the fun. You carefully release the handles, one at a time, and go check on the joke that is making the two people so amused.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Ohhh, make it one of those boomerang videos, and add a caption like… I know! “I drink steroids for breakfast!” That’s going to get a ton of likes."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"It might just beat the one where we said we didn’t know they allowed elephants at the gym!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Confused, you discreetly approach from behind, trying to get a look at what they have on their screen. You find out that they are posting Picstagram stories of Elena, which they apparently have been filming without her knowledge.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"What if we make one teasing her for confusing the term muscle pump and make a joke about her using an air pump instead?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"Hmmm… too convoluted, maybe we just compare her to a balloon or something? I’m sure we can make a video of her taking a deep breath while benching, she wouldn’t even notice…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"OHHH! I think you are on to something - she looks extra-freaky when she does that. We might just break the 10k likes from last time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Your blood starts boiling. Elena is already shy and makes a point to only come to the gym late at night because she doesn’t want others seeing her… and here these two are making viral memes making fun of her? It’s a good thing Elena doesn’t really hang out on social media that much - if she knew about this, she might stop getting out of her house entirely!<br><br> The thing is, the more the two talk and laugh, the harder your fists tighten and your jaw clenches. You find yourself on the verge of cracking your teeth, so much you are gritting them. Your breath is heavy, and you frankly wouldn’t be surprised if you turned green and bulked out like that comic character - you are THAT angry.<br><br> You take a deep breath, because you are seriously a hair away from seeing red and just bulldozing everything in front of you. You make a mental note of how strong you are, and that comes with certain responsibilities - it could be pretty disastrous if you REALLY lost your temper. But you care deeply about Elena, and you realize you’d go the distance to protect her from this cruel world… still… deep sigh, <<print $playerFirstName>>.<br><br> <span id="choice"> <<link "This will not stand, I need to teach them a serious lesson.">> <<replace "#choice">> You tap one of the guys on the shoulder. Without looking at you, he waves off, saying they are busy now. You crack your knuckles, which makes quite a loud noise, and finally catches their attention properly. <<if $height >= 185>>Your shadow completely engulfs them, reinforcing just how much bigger you are. <</if>>As they turn, they freeze for a second as they fully realize how dwarfed they are by you, despite both being serious gym-goers.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear you talking about my friend."<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two stammer, locking the phone and hiding it behind their backs. <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Uh, us? No, we… we were just… looking at some funny memes."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You crack your knuckles a second time for impact. They both gulp.<br><br> <<if $muscle >= 85>> Without taking your eyes off them, you reach to the side and grab a barbell.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, is that so? Because I value privacy AND my friends. I might get REALLY upset if someone were to film my friends without permission - let alone make fun of them."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You start putting pressure on the barbell. Your traps, arms, chest and lats flare, making you look even bigger - like a cobra preparing to strike.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It makes me angry. And when I get angry… I sometimes lose control."<</Dialogue>><br><br> The metal rod creaks in your hands, as it starts slowly bending. The two take a half-step back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You see… my friend doesn’t always take the initiative to defend herself, so I need to be EXTRA vigilant of her. Which is why I make sure I’m strong enough to take care of her. In fact, I make sure I’m STRONGER than her."<</Dialogue>><br><br> You fully twist the barbell in half, and let a strong gust of air from your nose, like a boar ready to strike. That makes the two guys jump. You toss the bent barbell to them, and the two fumble and almost let the heavy twisted bar fall.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So you better HOPE I don’t find a single video or picture of her online when I get home later tonight… or I might get REALLY angry. Is that clear?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<elseif $submissiveDominant > 1>> You look at them, and reach for their phone. They try to stop you from getting it, but they don’t have much of a choice against your incredible might.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really? Then I want to see it too. Why don’t you unlock it and share, then?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They look at each other, quickly panicking. They stammer, trying to come up with excuses, but failing to even articulate a proper sentence.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come ON! I really want to see the funny memes! If I’m not amused… I may have to find some fun in trying to figure out if I can crack a smartphone with just one hand!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You start tensing your hand, and the poor device seems to slightly bend before you even put any real effort. The owner of the device just unlocks it before you do any real damage, and you can see the video of Elena with a funny caption on Picstagram.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, so THAT is what you find funny? Big, muscular girls are a joke to you, is that it? I don’t think I get it, could you explain, please?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Their faces get drained of all blood as they experience terror from your mass and dominance. You step closer, enough for them to feel the heat radiating from your sweaty body.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? Aren’t buff girls funny? Why aren’t you laughing, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You return the phone to the guy.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I am giving you 10 seconds to delete that account, any posts of my friend you have on social media… and God help you if I find another image of her online. Do I make myself CLEAR?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> He almost drops the phone as he rushes back to his Picstagram control panel, as his friend apologizes profusely. You tell them to NEVER come back to the gym at night, or there will be consequences. <<elseif $shyConfident > 1>> You grab your own phone, and switch the camera to selfie mode. You start recording a Picstagram account of yourself flexing, showing the two guys in the background. Loudly, you start narrating during your video:<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Still laughing at people who say I’m strong for a GIRL… I can’t believe there are dorks like those guys who think that a gym is a place to put people down on social media. Can you imagine those WIMPS judging people?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You focus on them over your enormous arms, making them look pretty pitiful - even if they are in decent shape. You give one of them a wedgie, still recording, lifting the guy by the trunk clear off the ground. You show them the video you just made.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Huh, what do you know, making fun of people on social media IS funny. Maybe I should post this and tag you two… maybe you guys want to armwrestle me and post that two? Wouldn’t that be a hoot?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They stammer, trying to come up with an answer, and you can see the terror in their faces as they realize the humiliation they could endure if this went live.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"OOOOOOOR… we could agree that shaming people on social media is dumb, and you delete your account right now and pray I never find ANY pictures or videos of my friend being made fun of, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<else>> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I’m not one for violence, but I am really protective of my friend. You don’t want me reporting your account for harassment, right? Can we all just agree that it’s dumb? Now delete that before I show what my anti-bullying stance is in detail, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <</if>> The two nod, and run away trying to quickly delete their Picstagram account. You hope that Elena never gets to see that, knowing how much it would hurt her. How can people be so mean? While part of you wishes that Elena would stand up for herself, you can’t help but appreciate her innocence and peaceful nature even more. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</link>> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "Maybe I just need to explain that Elena is shy and they should refrain from doing that, they’ll understand.">> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, you two. Yeah, you."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They look at you, confused.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"GEEEEEEEZ LOUISE! Are they just giving steroids as a sign-in bonus for girls at this gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Haha. Did anyone ever tell you two are really funny? No? Why am I not surprised?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> The two snort with more laughs, and you roll your eyes.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Alright, fun time is over now. I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and ASSUME you two aren’t aware, but Elena is actually very shy and sensitive, and it would really hurt her if she found out people are making fun of her size online."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Well, duh, why wouldn’t they? The girl is a freak - and apparently, so are her friends, damn!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You wince, and give a very angry smile. Control yourself, <<print $playerFirstName>>, it’s just some teen guys who don’t know better, let’s make them grow as people, right?<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, how would you feel if someone made fun of you wearing a sleeveless top thinking your arms are somehow worth showing off?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"DAAAAAYUMMMM! You just got SERVED, dude!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And YOU are one to talk? I’ve heard about skipping leg day, but the chicken coop called, they wanted their drumsticks back."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They both get silent and awkward, as you give them both a playful but strong tap on the back.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"See, now imagine me posting our little conversation online to all your friends, and random people on the Internet. Not so much fun, right? And Elena happens to be very shy on top of that."<</Dialogue>><br><br> They seem divided about the whole thing - they clearly know the clout they got from their viral videos, but they apparently had never been on the receiving end of the bullying.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"She means quite a lot to me, so I will insist that you delete anything you already posted about her, and refrain from taking any more footage of her without permission. How about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You can see the pair isn’t sure how to proceed. Your point clearly came across, but they are very used to just shaming others online for clout. So… you figure you might just have to get down to their level after how.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Tell you what - why don’t we armwrestle for it? If you win - you can keep the videos live. BUT if I win, you have to take her stuff down and post the video of me beating you… in fact, I’m willing to take on both of you at once!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They are intrigued by the proposal, but quickly realize there’s a very real chance that you could probably take the two of them down… and how much fun they would be made of online.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"I GUESS we could take it all down. I suppose we were mean doing it in the first place…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"THAT’S what I wanted to hear!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You tap both of them on the head, and watch as they remove the videos. You hope they learned their lesson, and will be more mindful of other people’s feelings in the future when trying to go viral… or… well, you might just have to feature them on your own Picstagram in the future after all! <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <<Failed>> <<replace "#choice">> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… excuse me, but I think you guys are making fun of my friend on social media?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They turn to see who is talking to them, and are quite surprised to see another mammoth girl.<br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"GEEEEEEEZ LOUISE! Are they just giving steroids as a sign-in bonus for girls at this gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You blush a bit, sighing in frustration but decide to stand your ground.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Look, I just don’t think that’s nice, alright? She’s pretty shy and she would be devastated if she found out people are making fun of her online."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"Well, who is she to complain about devastation? I bet she leaves a trail of destruction wherever she goes!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You feel your anger welling more and more. You close your eyes and take another deep breath.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m just asking nicely, please, don’t make fun of her, she already has a complex about her body, it would REALLY hurt her, OK?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 2">>"Why shouldn’t she? A freak like that really should have some issues - and I’m not just talking about breaking chairs wherever she goes!"<</Dialogue>><br><br> You bite your tongue as you wince, taking yet another deep breath. Your heart is now racing. Your knuckles are turning white from squeezing them so much.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"All I am saying is, can you be mindful of her feelings? I’m sure there are other cool viral things you can post for social clout."<</Dialogue>><br><br> <<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy 1">>"I dunno, man! Not even sure she HAS feelings. I’m pretty sure a train could hit her and she wouldn’t even notice…"<</Dialogue>><br><br> Without thinking, your anger takes over and you punch the concrete wall to your side, cracking it. The impact also makes one of the weight racks tumbles. The two guys experience pure terror at your display of rage and strength, and immediately go speechless.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I really am asking nicely. Could you just DELETE those posts RIGHT NOW?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> It takes a few seconds for them to unfreeze from the shock, but they go and delete the whole account right before your eyes.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And, again, nicely, please refrain from ever filming her without permission? In fact, why don’t you make that a general rule, how about that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br> They nod in agreement, and walk back without facing away from you. You take a deep breath of relief, your introverted side gasping for air after this weird incident. You check your hand, which is bruised and slightly cut from the impact. Still, you look at the cracked concrete, kind of amazed at your own strength. But even that fades away as you think of poor Elena, unaware of this horribly bullying. You pray she never finds out about these videos, as you know it would probably be devastating. <<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>> <</replace>> <</PersonalityCheck>> </span>`

With absolute focus, she keeps repeating the motion, seemingly unaware of anything around her. Yet, despite her size, everything about her gives you this dainty vibe: the sounds she makes, being secluded in a corner, and maintaining this slouched posture, almost as if she was willingly trying to miniaturize herself.

Even your breath seems to require more energy, but your body feels like a power plant, your massive shape almost incongruent with your reserves of stamina. Your oversized hand takes a firm grasp of the biggest weights you can find, lifting slowly and graciously, respecting the grind that you eagerly look forward to. With that, your workout begins, pumping iron while maintaining proper form carefully, catching eyes here and there from ongoing gym members, including one in particular that hadn’t noticed you before. As the exercise continues, the fire in your body are kindled, along with heaps of muscle mass expanding due to excitement and use. Each pump is counted, calculated, and executed to the best of your ability, resulting in yet another amazing workout. <br><br>Before you know it, time flew beyond your ken, as two hours already passed. With your body feeling undeniable fatigue, you still crave for more. The used weights were slowly laid to rest, dripping with about as much sweat as your face. The corded muscles on your rugged back pulled and flexed, craning your torso upward, eyes scanning the environment like a predator ready to pounce. It was then that you envisioned your physique through the mirror, you newly-found gains a joy to behold. And yet, a massive dark figure stood above you, eyes beaming down at your every move. As your mind registers the interloper, a loud gasp fills your lungs as you nearly leap back from your seat. <br><br>A quiet squeak was reciprocated, with just as much shock, and the unexpected hunk scurries back a little bit, trying to hide its face behind rather dainty hands and flexed pecs. Once the initial shock has passed, you finally find it in yourself to stand up properly, turning to find the shy giant actually hasn’t fled, and despite her unmatched stature, her legs shake from fear. For something so wobbly, those legs still seem solid like adult trees. <br><br>As you approach her, she seems to tentatively lower her hands, revealing sparkling honey-colored eyes completely trained on you, all of you. Soon, a blush follows. It takes a few moments, but your eyebrows eventually furl with the realization of what just transpired.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Hey, it\'s you again."<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> "!!!..."<</Dialogue>><br>Her surprise at such a statement causes her pecs to contract involuntarily, shifting her entire posture, and even with her tan skin, her blush somehow becomes even redder. It only takes a moment for her to turn back and rush to the women’s lockers. This time, you can tell something different has happened. Just before she disappeared around the corner, she briefly turned to look back, eyes meeting yours in what seemed to be the most eager yet hesitant invite one could muster. Without a moment’s notice, you trail off after the caramel giant, intrigued to confirm if she finally has something to say to you.<br><br>Once you had arrive in the locker room, there she stood, still partially covering herself from sheer embarrassment, but now cornered, nowhere left to run. You approached slowly, as if trying to reassure a scared wild animal, which is the exact energy she is exuding. Before her expression grows too concerned, you stop in your tracks, standing a firm six paces away from this mountain of woman.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Hey, there.” <</Dialogue>><br>Perhaps this time she might respond. The warm curiosity in your voice seems to finally reassure her, almost like she was expecting screaming or disdain instead. Slowly, she lowers her gigantic arms to reveal her vulnerable expression, still besmirched by that deep blush. <br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “H-hello…” <</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “It’s nice to meet you, finally. I’ve been a bit curious ever since we first spoke… er, tried to, at least. My name is <<print $playerFirstName>>. What about you?”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “Oh! //S-scuzi//. //Sono// Elena. I mean, I’m Elena.”<</Dialogue>><br>She seems conflicted, scared beyond belief to even open herself this much, and yet eager to show herself to you. Subtlety wasn’t exactly her strong suit, though, considering her muscles constantly flex and bulge beyond her control, suggesting suppressed intent. You try not to avoid excessive eye contact to make her more at ease. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Wow, that’s a pretty name. I really like it!”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “O-oh, thank you. It is Italian. //S-sono italiana//.”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “I see.”<</Dialogue>><br>You don’t really know anything of the language, perhaps just the name of a few typical dishes. But somehow her meaning seems to easily surface from her empathetic nature. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “So, I’ve been meaning to ask, seeing as, well, you\'re about my size, maybe… you’d want to work out together? We kinda fell off the bell curve, so I think it might be nice to help each other.”<</Dialogue>><br>Her eyes widen in sheer disbelief of her ears. <br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “I’ve been meaning to ask you the same thing!”<</Dialogue>><br>She blurted it out finally, revealing what she’d apparently been wanting to do all this time.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “I… really admire how big you are, and I couldn’t keep myself from looking. So… I… would love… to… work out with… you…”<</Dialogue>><br>Although poor Elena seems to struggle to keep it together, you nod, trying to meet her halfway in her contained expression, but communicating that you understood her intent. You can feel her struggle, given her shy nature, it seems like a herculean task for her to open up to other people, so she must fight with loneliness quite a bit. But it seems like you were given a golden chance just now!<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">> “Sounds like a good deal! How about I meet you here tomorrow, around the same time, huh?”<</Dialogue>><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> “//S-si//!”<</Dialogue>><br>With that, you muster an awkward smile before trampling away with a sense of victory. Curiosity may have killed the cat, but there are plenty of lives where that came from.<br><br><<link "You got her to open up!." "gym">><</link>>'

In fact, it goes by almost completely unnoticed, since you are both in the zone, in a mostly empty gym. Sure, other gymgoers drop big barbells all the time there – but never with enough plates to make the entire building shake.

One could liken it to edging in a way, and with how proficient you’ve gotten at it, there was a bit of excitement to be had.<br><br>It seems like the moment wasn’t just yours though. Elena, your workout partner, lifts herself up with one massive crunch, her maze of abdominal muscles squished and outlined in a perfect manner, gravity bringing her massive chest to hang slightly over them. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>“Say… I don’t think I’ve ever asked, but what are your thoughts on exercising outdoors?”<</Dialogue>><br><br>The tan girl pauses for a moment, that familiar blush showing its colors.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>“O-of course!

Her voice is quiet as always. You allow her a moment to contemplate that, and find yourself joining her. What is important to her?<br><br>Well, working out is obviously a priority. But there must be something else you might discern given your growing intimacy with her. As these moments of golden silence mount, muffling the other gym goers grunting and groaning as they struggle with their weights, you still come up empty in the end. Come to think of it, you never really thought to ask her. With no better time than the present, you throw the proverbial line. <br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>“Hey, how about I take you out someday, and we spend some time discussing things that are important to us? You know, with two of us together, maybe we don’t stick out so much.”<</Dialogue>><br><br>Like a puppy being called by its owner, Elena bursts away from her thoughts, a heat wave painting her face while her brain reluctantly tries to wrap itself around your request.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>”Y-you want to… take ME out?...

    content: `As you awkwardly find a way to cross the gym’s turnstile with your mammoth thighs, you find Elena doing something unusual - not actually exercising. She’s usually pretty focused while at the gym, rarely ever dilly-dallying or interacting with others, getting to work as soon as she arrives and leaving right after she finishes - so you are quite surprised to see her in the common area of the entrance.<br><br>It’s… quite a sight. Elena is crouched in front of the notice board in the lobby - the corkboard is set to “eye level”, but the little giantess proves that this is a somewhat relative concept. She looks at one colorful flier with the same intent of a child who stands guard in front of a fireplace on Christmas Eve: her eyes gleam with a hopeful eagerness and you can hear a loud sigh as you approach her.<br><br><<if $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s up, Elena? Thinking of joining a class? I bet you’d love some Tai Chi…"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<else>>You approach silently, and she’s so entranced by the flier that she doesn’t even notice.

I… got distracted."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Once again her voice was so soft, like a little songbird.<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I can see that…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You look at the pamphlet that had her so transfixed - it’s a commercial about a next exhibit at the local museum. The notice is adorned with a big red and yellow flower you’ve never seen before, described as the “queen of orchids”.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Southeast Asian flowers, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Again, Elena sighs, her expression filled with melancholy. You tilt your head, confused - you genuinely expected her to be quite excited about the prospect of seeing these plants up close. <<if $shyConfident > 0>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? I assume you are planning to go… right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<else>>You look at her, confused. Why does she seem so sad?

I can’t bear to ruin such a magical experience as the museo for them. It was one of my favorite pastimes back in Italia, you know? I would spend hours - history, art, even lo zoo. It was always magical."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Without even noticing, your fists ball in a tight squeeze. This feels horribly wrong deep inside - Elena’s selfless sacrifice… she might be a humongous specimen, but the mere idea of anyone (or ANYTHING) being afraid of her surfaces a mix of anguish, confusion and rage in you.<br><br>Quickly, your brain decides that it is your mission to make sure she gets to see this exhibit. The question is: how do you convince her to face her insecurity to do so?<br><br> <span id="choice1"> <<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 1 "Tell them you're busy">><<replace "#choice1">>You think hard for a second, there HAS to be a way she can go to the museum without having to worry about the children.

You can feel butterflies of anxiety fluttering in your stomach as it dawns on you that this is really happening… and in just a few days!<br><br>Elena profusely thanks you as she points towards the weights, indicating that she’s going back to her workout, and you follow her, realizing it will be hard to concentrate on the weights tonight.<<script>>const dateCopy = new Date(State.variables.gameDate.getTime());const nextMonday = new Date(dateCopy.setDate(dateCopy.getDate() + ((7 - dateCopy.getDay() + 1) % 7 || 7),),);State.variables.elenaDateTwoDate = nextMonday;<</script>><<link "Continue" "gym">><</link>><</replace>> <<Failed>><<replace "#choice1">><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Huh… why don’t we get you some sunglasses or something?

Elena’s shoulders slump, making her somehow look and feel… small? That alone would be shocking, but it’s the sadness in her that really stings, penetrating your heart like a knife.<br><br>This sparks even more emotion in you, making you rip the flier off the notice board, making the thumbtack fly as you intently scan the entire document in hopes of finding SOMETHING useful. The sudden motion makes Elena step back, scared. You don’t realize how fierce you look as you do, your protective side surfacing like a tiger defending its offspring from predators - you just HAVE to find a way to make this work!<br><br>And as you flip the pamphlet over, you notice something - along the address of the museum, there’s a notice that the place has special summer hours, exceptionally opening on Monday mornings. Hey, that probably means the place will be pretty empty… and the chances of a school excursion are slim to none!<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena, look! The Natural History Museum has special hours during the summer! They open early on mondays!!! It’s going to be super empty, and no school would schedule a museum visit at that time!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Elena is completely taken aback. In an uncharacteristically forward fashion, she snags the paper from your hands and confirms the details. Her eyes spark with joy and hope once more.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I would love to go with you, how about next Monday? You think that works for you?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Elena blushes something fierce, and you can almost feel the hairs on her arms standing up as she looks at you like a deer under headlights. She turns her head sideways, trying to avoid direct eye contact, and then launches on an unexpected hunt for the lost thumbtack. Damn! You probably should have broken that subject slowly…<br><br>Elena finds the errant thumbtack, and turns her back to you as she affixes the leaflet back on the notice board. It’s taking all your self-control not to bring your palm to your forehead in frustration for your silly faux-pas with your shy companion. If only you could turn back time…<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Mi piacerebbe molto. I would love that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Wait, what? It was just a low whisper, which you almost didn’t hear since she was turned away from you but… did she just…?<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh… so… see you there?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>She turns, still somewhat avoiding eye contact, and quickly nods with a smile. Before you can reply, she’s off to lift weights, leaving you dumbfounded. I guess it’s really happening! You smile radiantly, and start leaving the gym… when you realize you haven’t worked out yet, and do a 180 towards the weight rack, realizing you’ll probably be very distracted during your exercises… <br><br><<link "Continue" "gym">><</link>><<script>>const dateCopy = new Date(State.variables.gameDate.getTime());const nextMonday = new Date(dateCopy.setDate(dateCopy.getDate() + ((7 - dateCopy.getDay() + 1) % 7 || 7),),);State.variables.elenaDateTwoDate = nextMonday;<</script>><</replace>><</PersonalityCheck>> <<link "She just needs to face her concern - children can be very understanding!">><<replace "#choice1">><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena, my dear… this is clearly very important to you.

They’ve seen EVERYTHING on the Internet. Heck, I blush at some stuff kids think it’s natural.

Yeah, maybe that wasn’t the biggest help, she probably isn’t too thrilled with the idea of being seen as a freak either.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Listen, either way, my point is: you can’t live your life worried about what others think to the point where you don’t do the things you love.

She sighs once again, and looks back at the pamphlet.<br><br><<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Do you think there’s a time when the museo is more empty?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your chest puffs up proudly and you take a deep, excited breath as you see the hesitation in Elena.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, actually - the museum has special Monday morning hours during the summer.

While she’s not acting downright mousey as when you first met her, she is also strangely cold. As you load huge plate after huge plate on your side of the bar, she just avoids your gaze entirely.

You might just need some popcorn for this.<br><br>Emma looks evidently bothered by the innuendo, but plays it cool.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Emma\" \"Emma\">>\"And make it to-go, please, I don’t have much time.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"Oh, I can get behind you going somewhere… with me, big mama!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue \"Emma\" \"Emma\">>\"AHEM! Excuse me…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma lowers her glasses, bending down to read the nametag on Kris’s apron.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Emma\" \"Emma\">>\"… Kris… but I find this behavior outright unprofessional. Please avoid this kind of language or I might have to speak to your manager.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You find your eyes stuck at this exchange, the cup of coffee permanently stuck on your lips as you watch intently for the outcome.<br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"Hmmm… yes, that suit and this demanding businesswoman thing you got going REALLY compliments your generous figure, lady. What do you say we go in the back and you can play strict teacher with me… I could REALLY use a spanking! I’ve got a slapper I’m DYING to try out!!!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma pulls out the implement from her back pocket, and gives herself a very loud slap on her tush.<br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"Oh, yeah, that is what I’m talking about. What do you say we go somewhere more private and we do some librarian roleplay, you and me?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma still looks at her coldly and unflinching. At this point, you are on the edge of your seat - this is better than TV! You’ve seen reality shows with less drama! As you take another sip of your drink, Kris bends over the counter and slaps Emma’s butt with the implement.<br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"Come on, I can see in your eyes, just how bad you want to discipline me. And don’t think you fool me with that buttoned-up suit, I have a sixth sense for big girls… and you are ONE BIG MAMMA! Just look at those stretched buttons on your shirt…\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris starts licking her lips and making grabby motions with her hands, it would seem like she is intent on pushing Emma past her breaking point, but failing so far. However, you feel like the gauntlet has been thrown, and your instincts are confirmed as Kris escalates this cold war: she flat out reaches across and squeezes Emma’s sleeve - a mix of surprise and delight on her face.<br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"WHOA! You REALLY are hiding the goods, mommy! You are a hardbody under all that corporate packaging! What I wouldn’t give to be in your board meeting, bringing a bad report so you have to chastise me in front of the whole room!\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma very carefully but emphatically slaps Kris’s hand away. It’s subtle, but a barrier has been crossed. You can’t quite put your finger on it, but something has changed in Emma’s composure - it’s like she is… tense? Almost like you could perceive her heartbeat accelerating below her veneer of self-composure.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Emma\" \"Emma\">>\"Listen here, KRIS. I want some coffee. This is a simple business transaction, and all I expect is for you to follow the training I’m sure was given to you on how to handle a customer. So I’m giving you a last chance before I am forced to call your manager and file a formal complaint.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Emma is very smart, but she is failing to understand that she’s playing right into Kris’s hand. The more serious she gets, the brattier is the response. And this one… might just have lit her fuse. Kris slides over the counter, and slides a hand under Emma’s very tight skirt, partially revealing some incredibly toned thighs. Emma takes a very forceful step back, and you could swear she’s pulling her hand back to slap Kris in the face…<br><br>However, that hand goes to adjust her glasses. Instead of blowing up, she gets more serious and calmer.<br><br><<Dialogue \"Emma\" \"Emma\">>\"I apologize, clearly, this establishment does not vet their employees well enough. I shall take my business elsewhere. Have a good day.\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And, with that, Emma turns and leaves. Kris shouts, shaking the unnamed cup in the air:<br><br><<Dialogue \"KrisObsessed\" \"Kris\">>\"ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T WANT TO PUNISH ME? I EVEN WROTE “MOMMY” ON YOUR CUP, DO YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT AS A SOUVENIR?\"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You watch, cup still firmly glued to your lips this entire time, as the manager runs after Emma to apologize, and Kris just retreats to the back, biting her lip and rolling her half-closed eyes in an expression that would be at home in any porn movie. Well, you always wanted to see the irresistible force paradox resolved, and this is probably as close as you are going to get.'

        content:  `You get into some casual talk with Kris during her shift at the Coffee Corner. It's been relatively tame given who you are talking to, but you never really know with her. It's a refreshing change of pace, to be able to talk to her about the new movie she'd just watched, or the new meal you tried to cook the other day. Your little moment is unfortunately cut short by a sudden tightness in your chest, one that you have grown familiar with. You wince a bit, and look around for an escape route. You're going to have to find somewhere to duck away to take care of yourself, or else you're going to risk a very embarrassing leak.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris? Where's the restroom around here?">><</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Sorry. Only one we've got is for employees. And even then, the plumbing is all messed up."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>Shoot...<</Dialogue>><br><br>Your eyes dart around, praying for some private spot to relieve yourself inside the coffee shop. Kris eyes you curiously, until her eyes wander over your body and notices your arms wrapped around your breasts. You see her eyes widen as she puts two and two together. She leans in and lowers her voice to a whisper.<br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Good God. Are you... leaking?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You drop to a whisper to answer to her pleading question.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yes! This is the worst! I need to relieve myself, like, RIGHT NOW, or I'm going to spray all over the counter!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris's eyes haven't lost their laser focus on your bursting breasts. She nods along quietly as her mouth hangs slightly open. If you let her go for a while longer, you're fairly certain she would start drooling, or worse yet… personally taking care of your milk.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Kris!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Right! Come on, come with me."<</Dialogue>><br><br>She slips away behind the counter and gestures for you to follow. You tail her, leading you to a door marked "Employees Only". She slips her key, unlocks the door, and hurriedly points for you to go inside. You slip through and she follows you inside, locking the door behind her. It seems Kris has led you into a storage closet. It's a little cramped, but there's still enough room for both of you to just get around. She dashes and rummages through one of the storage shelves, grabbing a stereotypical tin bucket and hands it over to you.<br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Here. Not fancy, but it should get the job done for you. Just some old stuff we used for Thanksgiving decoration last year."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, my God. Kris, you're a lifesaver, thank you so much. I'll be quick, I can come back out and join you in a minute."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You sigh in relief, and grab the hem of your top, ready to quickly relieve the pressure from your chest. Just as you are about to pull your breasts free, you realize that Kris hasn't moved from her spot. She's still staring at you in the same zombified state.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... I said: thank you, Kris. I'm good, I'll see you outside."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I can help."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Excuse me?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Come on, you're in a hurry, right?

You raise the tip of your top up, letting your breasts flop free.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Okay. Come on, get over here."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris's face looks like you just handed her a million dollars. She practically leaps forward, hands clasping at your breasts and milk leaking out between her fingers.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ah! AH! Ahhhh. H-hey, go easy there!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Hey, I'm just doing my job!<</Dialogue>><<if $Dominant >= 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Fine, if that's how you're gonna be..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris dove so eagerly that she's practically bear hugging you. That actually comes in handy for what you had in mind. You grab Kris by her hair and firmly press her mouth against your exposed nipple. Fresh milk readily sprays out into her mouth.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Drink up, girl!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You hold Kris firmly in place and, to your surprise, you feel her eagerly sucking on your breast. In fact, you can hear her moan and feel her shuddering as you empty your tit into her. You blush at the sight, not entirely sure how to feel about this whole scenario. But you're getting your needs taken care of, Kris is indubitably enjoying yourself. And you don't hate this feeling either, to be perfectly honest.<br><br>A few minutes later, and a quick switch from one breast to the other, you finally feel yourself drained dry. Kris releases her hungry mouth from your nipple with loud pop, putting her hands on her stomach.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow. I really didn't think you had it in you. Good work."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris contentedly pats her belly as you cover back up.<<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Whew! That's my lunch taken care of, anyway. Thank you, mommy."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don't be creepy. Come on.

Come on, let's get out of here."<</Dialogue>><<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Be careful! If you're too rough, you're gonna-"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Without even realizing it, you've been backed into a wall. Kris pins you gently, leaning and latching her mouth onto one of your leaking nipples. She sucks hungrily, and you can feel milk rushing out of yourself faster than you ever have before, waves of pleasure washing over your entire body. Against your will, quiet squeals escape your lips. Kris responds by wrapping her arms around you in a bear hug and eagerly burying her face in your blossoming breast. Your breath quickens and you can feel your face blushing as Kris proceeds to suck you dry while you moan and squirm under her touch. Finally, that breast is done with, and she lets go with a loud pop.<br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Look at you, giving it all up like a good girl!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Gah! Just shut up and finish the job!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"So forceful all of a sudden! Well, if you say so…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>She eagerly shoves her face against your other breast. Incapable of putting up any resistance, your knees quiver and you pant as she eagerly sucks at your teat. It all happens in a flash making you lose the concept of time, but you finally feel dry. Kris seems to realize this as well, as she removes her hands from you with a contented sigh.<br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Damn. You ought to see someone about selling your milk, that was some good stuff!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You haven't quite recovered your breath yet, so all you can muster is a quiet groan and a defiant look.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, *gasp* you sure look like you… *huff*… enjoyed yourself."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I could say the same thing, darling."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... Shut up."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Just sayin'."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don't you have work to get back to?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Shit. I guess you are right. Bet there’s a line out the door. But it was worth it! Talk to me again if you need another milking, cowgirl!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris lets herself out of the closet with a wink and a wave. Blushing as a result of torrent of emotions inside you right now, you cover back up and wait a few brief moments before you let yourself out as well.<</if>><<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>><</replace>><</link>><<link "Are you kidding? No!">><<replace "#choice">><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You can't be serious!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"I'm serious as a heart attack!

I'll see you outside."<</Dialogue>><br><br>You glare at her, the look on her face makes it clear that you got your point across. She huffs and rolls her eyes.<br><br><<Dialogue "Kris" "Kris">>"Okay, okay, message received. Youcan have the place for as long as you need it. I'll be outside when you're done."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Kris waves and lets herself back out of the closet, waving as she goes. Finally at peace, you free your breasts from the confines of your shirt, and you prepare the bucket under one nipple. Sweet relief comes as you squeeze your breast, milk spurting forth, frothing loudly into the bucket. A few minutes later, you are blissfully empty and, without any better option, you simply leave the bucket of dairy lying on the floor. You hope none of the employees mistakes it for the actual product.<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>><</replace>><</link>></span>`

<<set $tashaOpinion += 10>>The thrift store is just fun to browse, and with all that has been going on, it's an easy way to pass time. Going through the various bins and displays, you find all kind of stuff; old toys, ancient furniture, weirdly labeled metal cannist - Wait, what? You grab the receptacle from the display, feeling the weight in your hand. It's almost identical to the one you found in your fridge, the one you drank by accident. Panicking, you search for the owner, finding a diminutive old lady. Running over to her, you grab her in a hurry, perhaps a bit rougher than you should.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"E-Excuse me?! W-where did you get this bottle from?!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Hmmmm? Oh, that will be 5 dollars, my dear..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What? NO! I mean, where did you get this? Miss, please, this is rather important..."<</Dialogue>>

Finally she seems to comprehend your query, adjusting her glasses and inspecting the odd metallic cannister and its label.

<<Dialogue "Tasha" "Tasha">>"Let me see... Ah, yes. The university was getting rid of several boxes of the stuff a while ago. But someone mixed them in our stock room, so it takes a while to sort them out and get them on the shelves. And every now and then someone finds one and sells it back. Just come back later, I swear they keep popping up like mushrooms. Maybe I can be of more help after I’m done cleaning the stock room."<</Dialogue>>

At least now you have a clue. The boxes were left behind, and have gone to... God knows where. It might be a good idea to check in with Tasha every now and then, and inquire further about where she got them from or if she knows anything else. But given how hard it is to keep a proper conversation with her, this might be a challenge unto itself.

You almost didn’t see the discreet tailor shop there, but you quickly realize this could come in handy. With the move and all that has been going on, your clothing isn't in the best shape. Inside the cramped workshop, a giant hunches over a tiny and ancient-looking pedal-powered sewing machine. He has several pins in his mouth, and is calmly working on some unrecognizable article of clothing, spools of fabric surrounding him.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Um, excuse me. Do you repair clothes?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sir? I need something adjusted?"<</Dialogue>>
He slowly and casually takes pin by pin from his mouth, very meticulously placing them on a blue cushion resting on this work surface.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"... I'm busy."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Right but... um, I got this ripped... think you could fix it later? No hurry."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"... Leave it on top of that pile."<</Dialogue>>

He raises his chin towards a tall pile of varied articles of clothing. You carefully place it there, and the man doesn’t even acknowledge it. His squinting eyes continue purely focused on the task at hand. You can’t help but notice that, despite his immense size, his hands are so incredibly deft it's almost entrancing to watch.

The moment you enter, his voice booms out, as theatrical as Johan can get;

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Welcome, mortal visitor to the plane of - Oh, it's you! Hahaha, I was expecting some other people, but I guess it’s a bit early! Come on in! I'm just having DnD in - oh, about an hour or so. Guess I got set up a too early. I’m kinda anxious, believe it or not!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh... right. Er, if you're expecting people, I'll come back -"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"No, no! Do stay! Have you ever played some tabletop RPG before? "<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You mean like the pen and paper stuff with the elves? Like, those garden statues?"<</Dialogue>>
Johan’s chin drops, like you just said some blasphemy - he doesn’t look insulted, just really surprised.<br><br> 
<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Listen, now that you're here, why don't you give it a spin?! I promise it's not as weird or intimidating as it looks!"<</Dialogue>>

That's one hell of a promise because it does look weird. But he seems to be having fun, so what do you have to lose? Sitting down, <<if $muscle >= 90 || $fat >= 70 || $breasts >= 100 || $height >= 300>>on the floor as to not damage anything with your mass,<<elseif $muscle >= 50 || $fat >= 50 || $breasts >= 50 || $height >= 210>>, the chair groans under you,<</if>> a table full of nerdy shit is sprawled out before you. And with all the enthusiasm Johan is known for, he begins.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"So, this is Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth edition. In it, you play an adventurer while I take the role as storyteller; it is by my whims that you will succeed and fail! My whims... and those of the dice! Now, we first should make a character. What would you like to play as? A strong and fierce barbarian?! A clever but sneaky rogue?! A wise wizard, expert in the arcane arts?! Or a nimble elven ranger? Wait, wait, you clearly don't know what any of that means. Hmmm... With your personality... I think... yeah! <<print $dndCharacter.race>> <<print $dndCharacter.class>>!"<</Dialogue>>

With a big smile, he scribbles for a while before handing you a piece of paper with a LOT of numbers on it. Yet despite how intimidating it is, Johan carefully explains everything bit by bit; what different attributes are, what skills you got, even dropping some tips on how to play. The passion in his eyes is contagious, he lives for this. You were used to him talking AT you, now he is being very inviting, allowing you to join in his passion. 

<<if $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian">>Turns out you got handed a big half-demonic barbarian; big, beefy, and hits hard. Heh. Almost like he knows.
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "cleric">>The character you play is a cleric, following some kind of deity in this fantasy setting. Your character mostly supports others and is a rather shy and meek half-elf. Not that far off.
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "paladin">>The character you play is a paladin, following some kind of deity in this fantasy setting. With heavy armor, a burning desire to cleanse heresy and enough zeal to sink a battleship, you're sure this is going to be fun!
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "warlock">>The character you play is a warlock, granted magical powers by a demon. Or devil. Apparently that makes a huge difference. But no matter what, you've got a magical sugar daddy and a whole world to make yours!
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "rogue">>The character you play is a sneaky rogue, ready to steal, backstab and assassinate! Oh, you can't wait to see what you can do with this all!
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "wizard">>The character you play is a wise wizard, knowing all kinds of spells and shit. Neat!

Cursing under your breath, having had enough, you are faced with an unexpected reaction.

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"... Need some help?"<</Dialogue>>

The constant whirr of the machine, a constant in this small room, stops dead, and the wooden chair screeches for the first time, Simon standing up (well, as much as he can given the low ceiling). The shock makes you jump, knocking over another pile of clothes.

How did he - Well, he did see you come in day after day with new clothes, and witnessed all your changes first-hand. But how is he so casual about all this? There is something else going on, you know it.

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"I got this sewing machine you can buy. You get some fabric and I'll teach you how to use it."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"You're a good customer, and at this point I feel like I'm robbing you. Buy the machine. Buy some cloth. I get mine from Tasha, she always has some lying around. Come back when you got both, and I'll explain the basics."<</Dialogue>>

It would seem he is serious about it. Well, you could use the help, so it sounds like a good plan.

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"Good. Let's begin."<</Dialogue>>

Ever a man of few words, he simply turns around and takes the fabric from your arms. Nodding at you to stand closer, he quickly gets to work. His voice is calm and oddly soothing, and surprisingly patient. You can see why he sits here, working to intently: there is an odd, calming zen quality to it. A practical teacher, he sits you down with the old sewing machine, and quickly lets you get to work, making some basic procedures. Before you even realize it, an hour has passed. Simon gets up, looking at your work.

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"Shoddy work, but it will do for now."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Um... okay?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"You just started. Shoddy work is enough for now. That wasn't an insult."<</Dialogue>>

Well, he's not once to mince words. His directness doesn't feel like derision. In fact, it seems closer to a compliment, if anything! But with this new skill, managing your growing need for clothing will become a LOT easier. You can now adjust clothing, and who knows! If you keep improving, you might just be able to make your own clothes soon enough.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Seriously, how can I thank you for this?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Simon" "Simon">>"No need. You needed some help, and I like helping people. And besides, I've been wanting to get rid of that machine for a while now. Just takes up space. And if you ever need lessons, you know where to find me."<</Dialogue>>

Arriving at the address Kris texted, you find yourself in front of a very peculiar bar. The atmosphere of the old building betrays the many stories it must carry. The red bricks are heavily stained, and the prevalent smell of smoke and heavy alcohol drifts towards you from a distance. There is a huge bouncer standing outside the door, looking at you. <<if $muscle > 75>>You can tell from his eyes that he is secretly hoping you don’t cause any trouble, because he does not want to mess with you. Heh, You can’t blame him, he’s huge himself, but you are on a class of your own!<<elseif $muscle > 50 || $fat > 50>> He checks you out, giving you a respectful nod. Seems like he has respect for your size.<<elseif $breasts > 35>> His eyes linger on your chest. Of course they do. Yet, he respectfully returns to his neutral position the moment he notices you're uncomfortable.<<else>> The stare is intimidating enough, telling you not to cause problems.<</if>> Soon enough, Kris walks by, in a very casual but appropriate outfit for this joint. Unsurprisingly, her first reaction is eyeing you hungrily.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Hehe, fuck, you look amazing. Did you get this big just for me?"<</Dialogue>>

Not waiting for a response, she grabs your arm, practically dragging you inside. The bouncer moves to stop you, but it would seem he knows Kris well. The moment he sees her, he steps aside to let the two of you in.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You come here often?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"You bet I do. This is a bar that is popular with a lot of the powerlifters in town, for hooking up and… other things.

<<set $johanFirstDateSuccess to 0>>Johan excitedly returns to his seat opposite you, looking from behind what you can only describe as a tiny cardboard wall sitting on his table and covering his mysterious ream of unknown documents. He mutters to himself, and seems to be thinking very hard. You set your little figurine in place on one of the little hexagons on the mat in front of you as Johan springs up excitedly.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Okay! So... As we begin our story, you have already been travelling for weeks. You've been following rumors of a magical <<if $dndCharacter.class is "paladin" || $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian">>hammer<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "cleric" || $dndCharacter.class is "wizard">>staff<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "warlock" || $dndCharacter.class is "rogue">>amulet<</if>> that is supposed to contain untold power! The sort of thing that could decide the fate of the world! And at last, you're so close! You should be able to reach it today, but... alas! Your map says there should be a bridge here, but nothing! Just a ravine, at least <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>four meters<<else>>a dozen feet<</if>>across! You look left and right, but this bridge is nowhere in sight. You could go looking for another way to cross, but who knows long that would take? Now, this is a predicament... How will you solve this problem?"<</Dialogue>>

He grins ear to ear, and looks at you expectantly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, uh... So, is it my turn now? What should I do?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That's the beauty of it! It's like we're writing a story together, and you're in control of the main character. Think it over for a bit. Imagine <<if $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian">>you're a mighty and savage barbarian<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "cleric">>you're a holy woman wielding the power of your gods<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "paladin">>you're a literal knight in shining armor<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "warlock">>you hold dark, eldritch magic in your hand<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "rogue">>you're a sly, stealthy thief or assassin type<<else>>you're an actual wizard, with all kinds of spells in your book<</if>>.

<<if $dndCharacter.class is "cleric" or $dndCharacter.class is "paladin">>Johan pauses for a moment. His face scrunches up as if he's thinking hard.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"While, yes, you have magic at your fingertips, I'm struggling to think of a spell that you have access to that would help..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I'm a sort of priest, right? Can I, like... pray to my god for help?"<</Dialogue>>

You see a smile on Johan's face.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I like the way you think. Roll your d20, that 20-sided die there, and let's see what happens."<</Dialogue>>

You fumble briefly through the small pile of dice in front of you, before Johan helpfully points out the roundest of the bunch. You give it a roll across the table. It comes to a stop revealing a 10.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is that good?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"It's... exactly the middle of the road. Let's say you stop and make a quick prayer to your deity. As you speak, you begin to believe you feel their presence with you, and your confidence rises. Do you still want to go through with this?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"...Yeah. Let's do it."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Okay! With your renewed vigor, you brace yourself and begin to charge towards the ravine. Slowly, slowly you pick up speed, then take a deep breath and leap! You're now sailing through the air, only the strength of your faith to save you! Give me another d20 roll!"<</Dialogue>>

You grab the same die and give it another roll, feeling a little tense as it clatters across the table. It slows to a stop on 13.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>You feel as though you're flying through the air, the other end of the ravine growing closer! You reach the peak of your jump. And you start to fall... and fall... and suddenly you're eye level with the edge of the ravine. You're falling faster, and faster, the other side now far out of reach! But then, you hit the side of the ravine, and slam to a stop. On reflex, you grab the first thing your fingers touch. You find yourself holding two rocks embedded in the canyon wall. You couldn't quite clear the ravine. But... you've caught yourself, and you're safe."<</Dialogue>>

You realize that you've been holding your breath for a moment now. You breathe again, looking at Johan, who is still smiling happily.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, I’m… uh… safe? That means I can climb up the wall?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"With some effort, yes. You slowly, carefully, start climbing your way up the canyon wall, and after a few minutes of work, you're at the ledge.
That was a pretty good idea, by the way. Maybe not the choice I would have made, but full points for the lateral thinking."<</Dialogue>>
<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian" or $dndCharacter.class is "rogue">>There's a moment of silence. Johan stares back at you blankly from across the table.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You know what? Full credit for guts. If you're sure you want to go through with it, grab that 20-sided die, your d20, and give it a roll."<</Dialogue>>

You fumble through your pile of dice for a moment, not totally sure which one Johan means. Fortunately, he helpfully sticks a hand out and points toward the roundest die of the bunch. Gently, you give it a toss across the table. It clatters and slows to a stop showing a 20! Both of you stop for a moment, grinning in disbelief.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Woo! That is a good thing, right?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"It's the best result you could have gotten! I'd say that's an auspicious sign! But was it good enough to clear the gap?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wait, what do you mean? If I got the best result, then..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Not guaranteed success, though! If you had tried to jump to the moon, I wouldn't have just let you succeed because you got lucky. But no takebacks now! The die has been cast, quite literally!
Filled with confidence that your intense wishing has paid off, you charge toward the canyon, all but certain that you will magically make your way to the other side! You break into a full sprint, picking up speed as you near the ledge, then leap!"<</Dialogue>>

Johan pauses dramatically and you realize you're holding your breath. You break into a smile and give him a nudge. He smiles back and flourishes.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"And... your feet find ground on the other side! It's not exactly a graceful landing. You stumble forward a few paces, flailing your arms as you do. But you're alive, and in one piece!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sounds like a good deal! What am I supposed to do?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"This one's easy. All you have to do is say that you're casting the spell. And then, go ahead and describe what it looks like."<</Dialogue>>

Johan leans forward expectantly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Eh... What do you mean? Aren't you supposed to do that?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I describe the world around you, sure. But your character is your own, you're in control of her! And I believe a good way of fleshing out a magic-user and making them your own is to describe what their magic looks like! Go ahead, don't be shy. Picture the moment in your head. You're casting a magic spell to fly over a canyon. Are you flying like Superman? Floating in a magic bubble? Just kind of walking on the air?"<</Dialogue>>

You pause for a moment. You hadn't exactly had time to put thought into this, but Johan looks like he's hanging onto your every word. Words you have yet to utter. You would ask for some help with this, but... the only time you've seen Johan this excited is when he's in the middle of one of his tangents.  You can't let him down like that.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Um... I guess, I would lift my arms into the air, out to my side. Like, palms up. And all my clothes start flowing around me as if the wind is picking up. I just... kind of shut my eyes and stand still and this invisible force just kind of lifts me up into the air. Like... I'm still as a statue but floating softly and gently over the canyon."<</Dialogue>>

There's a quiet moment as you finish your description. Johan is just continuing to stare at you with a smile on his face.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh... did I do this right?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"That was great, actually! I really like the mental image you got going there. Are you sure you've never done anything like this before?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Ooh, the gutsy, straightforward approach! I like it! All right, grab your 20-sided die and let’s see if you have what it takes."<</Dialogue>>

You look through the pile of dice Johan has set in front of you. After you spend a few seconds trying to count the number of sides on each one as quickly as possible, Johan leans in and points out the roundest of the bunch.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Sorry about that. I sometimes forget everything I need to explain. But you'll go ahead and roll that and add your Strength here <<if $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian" or $dndCharacter.class is "paladin">>, and your proficiency bonus here<</if>>... And the higher the total number, the better you do."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Right. Seems easy enough. All right, here it goes!"<</Dialogue>>

You give the little die a toss across the table. And comes to rest on a 15.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is that good?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Well, it's a 15 out of 20. So yes, I'd say so! Whether it's good //enough// is a different question. Let's see here... The chasm is this far across, default jump distance is equal to Strength, plus... mmm..."<</Dialogue>>

He rapidly mumbles to himself, apparently doing some calculations rapidly in his head.

Before you know it, you're at the point of no return! You wait until your feet are at the very lip of the crevice and leap!"<</Dialogue>>

He pauses dramatically. You hadn't realized until just now how invested you were in this. You're actually leaning in a bit, excited to see whether the imaginary you succeeds.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You put all the strength you have into your legs and launch yourself through the air! You sail through the air, the wind rushing against you! You reach the peak of your jump, looking down briefly to see the bottom of the chasm, looming menacingly below..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"But quickly you see the other side of the chasm approaching! Just as suddenly as you started the jump, your feet slam into the ground on the other side!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So... I made it?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You sure did, safe and sound!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Man, that was a lot of suspense for a quick jump!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"I'd never have it differently! The whole fun of this is that you don't always know how things are going to end up. No sense in spoiling the movie for yourself, right?
But you were very right in that this was just a jump. You still have a dungeon to delve into! Shall we move on?"<</Dialogue>>

<<else>><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Okay, off we go! You break into a sprint, rapidly picking up speed as you approach the lip of the chasm, and then leap into the air!

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"But! You're still moving forward, and you realize you can still save yourself! Give me another d20 roll!"<</Dialogue>>

You quickly reach for the same die and toss it across the table. It's an 18!

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"As you reach the wall and the other side, you scramble to grab onto something, and your hands find two solid rocks. You cling on for dear life, and you realize that you've stopped. You did it! You're alive!"<</Dialogue>>

	<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well... Not that I was hoping that a bridge would pop into existence in front of me, but... maybe I could ask for guidance or something? Like, have my deity help me figure out what to do? Because I'm a bit stumped."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, I should hope it's obvious, right? Let's get in there!"<</Dialogue>>

Johan leans forward a bit. His expression changes into something more serious. His voice lowers, and he sounds almost grim as he sets the scene.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"You approach the yawning cave. Everything beyond the entrance is pitch black... You slowly venture inward, your eyes gradually adjusting to the darkness within. It's deathly quiet in here... not even the sound of water dripping or wind whipping by you to keep you company..."<</Dialogue>>

Johan's voice grows quieter and quieter as he talks until he's just barely whispering. Then, without warning, he springs up from his seat and lets out a shrill shriek!

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"REEEAAAAAR!"<</Dialogue>>

Without explanation, Johan reaches behind his little screen and grabs several more figures, little green goblins holding weapons in the air. He slaps them down onto the mat in front of you, all around your character.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Before you can react, a horde of goblins jumps out from the rocks around you! They've got you surrounded on all sides! The one in front of you brandishes his sword and stares you down!

	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"That's a hit! Okay, so for damage, you look down here on your sheet, where it lists off your weapons. Then you can see here where it says 'Attack' and 'Damage,' it's important not to get those confused. See, the difference is that the Attack number here is a flat number, and that's what you're adding to your die rolls to see if you hit. The damage is represented as a die that you roll...<</Dialogue>>
	
	Before you know it, he's off on another tangent. You feel confident that you're getting it, but that feeling slowly fades the more he delves into the specifics. Eventually he looks back at you and sees the look of confusion on your face.
	
	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"Sorry about that. It's just so exciting to get to share this hobby with a newcomer! For now, just know that you hit the goblin pretty hard. You focus on strategizing, I'll handle the math and what you need to roll.<</Dialogue>>
	
	<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
	"All right. No fear, let's bash some goblins!"<</Dialogue>>

Following up on your first attack, you start cutting a swath through the horde of ankle biters as they charge you. Each time you toss the die and land another hit you can feel the adrenaline building up.
	
	<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
	"Woo! Another one bites the dust! Bring it on!"<</Dialogue>>
	
	Johan lets out a loud laugh at your reaction, his grin spreading across his face.
	
	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"Man, as much fun as I have playing this, I can't remember the last time I saw someone get so fired up over a fight! Come on, clean out the last of these gobs!"<</Dialogue>>
	
	By the end of the fight, you take a few blows and lose some HP, but the goblins are certainly no match for you. They all lie incapacitated on the floor as your character brushes herself off.
	
	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"Handled like a true warrior! But that's not going to be the last thing testing you. Ready to see what happens next?"<</Dialogue>>
	
	<<else>> You gleefully go to town, taking swing after swing at the green cannon fodder. You start to feel genuinely excited about this dramatic fight. Despite your passionate narration, you quickly realize you're being overwhelmed.
	
	<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
	"Shoot! I keep getting hit! How close am I to winning?"<</Dialogue>>
	
	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"There's only a couple left, and they're looking worn out! Don't worry, I think you've got this!"<</Dialogue>>
	
	<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
	"Grah! Okay, come on, dice! Get me through this, please!"<</Dialogue>>
	
	With some difficulty, you manage to bring the last of the goblins down with your hit points mostly intact. You heave a sigh of relief as Johan describes the last one falling.
	
	<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
	"Well, it wasn't exactly clean, but one-on-many combat rarely is! Good on you for tackling it. Feeling ready to move on to something else?"<</Dialogue>>

"No screeching this time, right?"<</Dialogue>>

"I wouldn't be a very good dungeon master if I answered that directly."<</Dialogue>>

Johan grins to himself as he gathers the goblins from the grid mat.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Ahead in the cave, you see something you hadn’t noticed before. Ahead, where the cave bends around a corner, there's a blue light, just about as bright as a torch, just faintly flickering just outside of view. As you carefully round the corner, you see a huge, circular door, easily taller than yourself. It's set apart cleanly into twelve different sections of stone, and each of them has some kind of rune on it. They're all glowing blue, giving off the light that tipped you off from around the corner."<</Dialogue>>

Johan's hands once again dive behind his screen and retrieve an illustration of the door he described. Dang, he really did come prepared.

"Oh. Yeah, yeah, we can do that. It's all right, not everyone likes puzzles in their game. We can jump ahead to what's next."<</Dialogue>>

Johan reluctantly reaches and retrieves the picture of his puzzle, a wistful look on his face.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>

The two of you dive into the challenge together. With you slowly plucking away at the clues, and Johan providing a gentle nudge here and there, after many long minutes of work, you feel yourself getting closer to the solution.

You and Johan go back and forth, taking turns to narrate your climactic battle with the lich. Despite any misgivings you may have had earlier, you can feel you've finally begun to enjoy yourself with this. And frankly, you've realized that it’s mostly due to Johan’s masterful companionship.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"The lich floats further into the air, raising a hand as if calling someone to him. You hear a groan and clattering, and two dead bodies lying on the floor next to you begin to shamble to life!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Ah, not going to fight me like a man, are you? I'll take care of these lame zombies, and then I'm coming for you!"<</Dialogue>>

Several turns go by...

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"The zombies crumple to the floor before you, but you look up, as you realize... The lich is holding a fireball in his hand! He lifts his arm into the air, pitching the incandescent sphere towards you, and before you know it, it explodes in front of you! Dealing... 35 damage!

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"What? No! I just started playing and my character's dead?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Whoa, whoa, not dead. You're just unconscious. And you may be lucky. Maybe the lich wants you alive. There's still plenty of room for a story we can tell here!"<</Dialogue>>

"Really?!?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Yes! In fact... you're supposed to be out cold, but let's say you're still conscious. You just can't move currently."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Okay? Where is this going?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
The lich looks down at you, still floating in the air above you, its face filled with scorn. It snarls... 'You did indeed fight valiantly... With a spirit I have not seen... in many aeons. This is my parting gift... You may live... But meddle not in my affairs any longer.'
And with that, he raises his hands and just blasts a hole in the ceiling of the cave, allowing some light into the room, and he flies off through it, out of your view."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Ah, man. I got to stay alive just to hear him gloat?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Not quite. Do you want to roll Perception for me?"<</Dialogue>>

You quizzically grab your die and give it a toss across the table.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"You feel your strength beginning to return, so you plant your hands on the ground and start to rise back up. But before you do, you notice a gleam from beneath the cauldron that the lich was using."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Huh? No way. Is that? I'm going to go take a look."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"You slip your hand beneath the cauldron, and, lo and behold... the mystical <<if $dndCharacter.class is "paladin" || $dndCharacter.class is "barbarian">>hammer<<elseif $dndCharacter.class is "wizard" || $dndCharacter.class is "cleric">>staff<<else>>amulet<</if>>."<</Dialogue>>

You burst into excited laughter at the realization. Poor Johan couldn't help but to give you a win in the end, sweetheart that he is.
In fact, now that you think of it, he's been nothing but sweet to you ever since you moved in. Even right now, he's just reveling in your excitement, clapping and laughing to himself.

Acting on instinct, you reach over and embrace him in a hug. <<if $height >= 190>>You tower over him, <<else>>You stand up to hug him,<</if>><<if $muscle >= 50>> and wrap your thick arms around him, the muscles pressing into him.<<elseif $breasts >= 50>> and as your huge chest presses into him, you cannot help but giggle a bit. <<else>> holding him in a warm embrace.<</if>>
He responds by blushing furiously. He's utterly taken aback, but he isn't frightened or struggling.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Uh... Thank you?"<</Dialogue>>

It was a gentle and soft kiss, a promise of more to come in the future. He gives no immediate response except to turn even redder than you thought possible.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Uh? Um... I... I'm not..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Thank you, Johan. You're a great guy. Very special to me. And I would really like to get to know you better."<</Dialogue>>

You plant another kiss on him, again stunning him into silence.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"I, ah... You, that is, I mean, uh..."<</Dialogue>>

It's just at that moment that the door behind you opens. A group of people you have to assume are Johan's friends come inside, staring open-mouthed at the sight of their friend embraced in your <<if $muscle >= 50 || $fat >= 50>>huge<</if>> arms.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Ah, right... I think it might be time for me to leave, huh?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Um... no. I mean, yes, that may be for the best. But I'll see you again soon!"<</Dialogue>>

You quickly say goodbye to Johan, excusing yourself to his friends, as let yourself out into the hallway. As soon as you shut the door behind you, you can hear his friends excitedly questioning him.
You breathe a happy sigh and make your way back to your apartment. You didn't know exactly what to expect from getting romantically involved with Johan, but you had a feeling it was going to be fun.

<<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>
"Actually... Yes. Yes, I'd like that very much!"<</Dialogue>>

His face lights up with a broad smile. You can't help but smile back.
Before you can say another word, you hear the door behind you fly open, and several excited voices announce the arrival of the original game party. Johan's friends let themselves in, before quickly going quiet upon realizing someone else is there.

As you take a moment to collect yourself, you can hear the voices excitedly shouting from inside his apartment, almost snapping you from the silly trance you find yourself in.

You and Johan go back and forth narrating your climactic final battle. As the fight goes on, you slowly realize that there's something missing compared to the rest of the game thus far. Johan isn't acting in the same bombastic way he had earlier. He's explaining what the lich is doing with its turn, but there's no poetry in his description anymore, no flair.

At the same time, you're beginning to realize that you're losing the fight. You started off strong, but the lich is quickly overpowering you, as you witness your steam fading in both reality and fiction.

This is pure you. Muscles tighten and goosebumps travel around, simply from sitting there. Just a small touch wouldn’t hurt? A single finger settles at the base, slowly working is way up the shaft, up and up until it reaches the head. Your eyes roll back, your body shivering from delight. It just feels to good to ignore, so incredibly orgasmic. Drool dribbles from the corner of your mouth, but you barely notice it. Or the fact that you’ve slid onto the floor, the cold stone only adding to the sensations against your buttocks. Another quick stroke and your mind is unable to think or resist. And another. And another. Before you realize it, your concept of time has disintegrated and you’re furiously stroking your dick, gritting your teeth.

Before we begin the game, you can customize your starting character a bit. You can spend <<print $startingSkillPoints>> point(s) to increase any skill. Skills have several benefits, and while these are your starting abilities, you may learn more during gameplay. You also have <<print $startingPersonalityPoints>> personality point(s) to customize your character. Personality determines a lot of the interactions with other characters, and may also fluctuate during the story.

<<if $currentDiet.name is "Just eat like normal">>
	Your basic diet isn't too out there. Some pancakes for breakfast, or maybe a bowl of granola with yogurt to get you going in the morning. Maybe some candy every so often, but not too much (of course). At lunch, you stick to a simple but practical sandwich. Dinner could be anything. Perhaps some pasta, or anything quick to make. Adventurous, it is not, but very simple, decently healthy, and, hey, requires little effort!
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Save time">>
	Today you just don't have much time. So you rush through everything, including your breakfast. A bit of fruit will have to do, or something else you can eat on the go. And without taking time to prepare, lunch and dinner will be mostly the same; instant noodles or maybe a microwave dinner, if you're lucky. It’s not good for your mood, but that’s the sacrifice you’ve made.
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Cheat day!">>
	YES, YES, CHEAT DAY! Oh, you've been looking forward to this; cake for breakfast, or no, maybe a couple of chocolate croissants! Whatever it is, then maybe you can prepare a big brunch, and then a SECOND big brunch or lunch or whatever, and then for dinner just pig out with a huge meal of whatever you feel like! Today is a good day for your mood, but not for your waistline!
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Balance day">>
	With all that’s going on it’s no surprise your body could use some help now and then, and today you're going to make up for it. For breakfast, some fruit with yogurt, and for lunch simply a nice vegetable soup. For dinner, you stick to broccoli with salmon. Recent events have made life stressful enough, and more than ever you realize that you need to take good care of your body.
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Protein rich diet">>
	Right, for today you have something special prepared to make sure you can optimize your muscle growth to its full potential: protein bulking. You start the day with a huge amount of cottage cheese and low-sugar granola. A few protein bars will get you through the morning, while for lunch you're already preparing an easy meal of chicken breast and broccoli. And for dinner, surprise, surprise, more chicken breast and broccoli! Sure, it’s not the tastiest, but it'll get your guns growing!
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Lean diet">>
	Today, you decided to go for a more lean diet; not something that'll leave you hungry or unsatisfied, but will help you lose some weight. A fruit salad for breakfast, some yogurt for lunch and some white fish, perhaps a nice salad for dinner... simple, lean and efficient! Or so you hope, at least.
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Fancy cooking">>
	Today is the day you're flexing those cooking muscles, trying new recipes or just having fun with it. For breakfast you'll be making croque monsieur, or perhaps eggs benedict with some oak-smoked salmon. For lunch you have it all planned out; a nice home-made stir-fry, and for dinner... nothing better than beef wellington. Will it be expansive as hell? Yes. Will it be bad for your waist? Sure. Is it worth it? OH, HECK, YEAH.
<<elseif $currentDiet.name is "Cutting">>
	You have a goal in mind, and that goal is cutting down on flab while keeping your muscles. Lean protein and a small caloric deficit will do just that. Cottage cheese for breakfast, some fruit for lunch, and white fish and chicken for dinner. Is it pleasant to eat? No. Will it help you get that summer bod? Fuck yeah!

<<if _morningRoutineWeight < 40>>
Still, its surprising how small your portions actually are. Your body doesn't need much, given how little fuel is required. One advantage though: cooking is a breeze!
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 50>>
Still, despite your recent growth, you still eat less than most. It’s increasing, sure, but your portions are small and cooking is quickly accomplished.
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 60>>
Still, it’s surprising that you eat an amount of food that even other people would consider average! Due to your growing body, it’s somewhat amazing how much you need now! Well, amazing to you; according to others, you're finally eating like a normal person. But to you, it looks HUGE.
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 80>>
 You spend more and more time cooking as your growing body just needs bigger piles of food to keep it fueled. Muscle, fat, height.... a lot is changing, and all of it requires nourishment. But there are some advantages; you got more experienced at cooking such amounts, and with a big mouth you can eat more!
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 100>>
The pile of food you eat every day keeps growing, and it’s almost worrying you by now! Others have started noticing too, and you need to buy more and cook more. It’s a good thing you can cook these amounts with ease, and wolf it down quicker, otherwise it'd become quite a bother.
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 125>>
The portion of food you eat is HUGE; your body is growing and, with it, the fuel it needs. Cooking has become quite a challenge, as the pile you need just keeps growing, and growing, and growing. Eating it is not the hard part; preparing is. Luckily, you're getting handy at that, but some cooking lessons could come in handy.
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 150>>
The piles of food you need to eat are almost ridiculous; it would be more than enough for multiple people, but your growing body requires all the fuel it can get to just maintain your current size, let alone keep growing! Each meal is huge and takes time to prepare, but cooking family-sized meals is no longer a hassle for you.
<<elseif _morningRoutineWeight < 250>>
The fridge is almost bursting at the seams with how much you now eat in a single day. Preparing it is almost a workout in and of itself, and consuming it a small spectacle. You can have a regular-sized meal in a single bite, no longer even really needing to chew. It’s all just fuel for your enormous growing body, and a growing body will always need more.
<<else>>
Each portion for you is now enough to feed a family for a day, that's how much you eat. It’s utterly ridiculous, and yet each day you now prepare such gigantic meals, only to consume them in a single sitting. Sometimes it’s just emptying an entire container into your waiting mouth, while sometimes you just take a huge pan and eat straight from it. Your growing body needs fuel, and it hungers for more.

	<p>Your expectations for college life: buying a lot of stuff, drunk parties... you didn't expect spending half an hour on the sink, squeezing milk out of your tits. Amazing. <<if $breasts > 100>>It's surprising you can get it done so quickly, considering those things barely fit through a door... each. Yet you squeeze and massage them, letting it all out. The sink nearly overflows, but luckily these buildings have decent plumbing.<<elseif $breasts >= 80>>And God, these things have gotten large... you just let them hang, though it's getting harder and harder not to make a mess with their immense size. Oh well, nothing to do but wait until they're empty.<<elseif $breasts >= 50>>You got huge breasts, no way around that. And as such, it takes longer for you to milk yourself dry. Heh... milk yourself. Fucking insane that you even do that these days...<<elseif $breasts >= 25>> So here you are, your tits above the sink, being massaged to empty them. Yeah, this is JUST how you imagined college life would be.<</if>></p>

You show up at the address Elena gave you, just a few minutes before she had asked you to arrive. It’s a busy street in a quiet part of town, populated with a bunch of cute little shops and people window shopping all around. You spot Elena, standing out in front of one of the establishments. Not that it’s hard to see her. Despite the two of you towering over everyone else present, she manages to look even more timid than she normally does.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Hey! It’s good to see you!”<</Dialogue>>

She is caught off guard, but you can see her expression immediately soften when she spots you. Not quite a smile, but compared to the near panic on her face moments earlier, it’s a marked improvement. She crosses the distance between you in a couple of long, quick strides.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“//Buona sera//. It’s good to see you too.”<</Dialogue>>

She stands very close to you, though not quite touching you. You can see her relax visibly, tension leaving her body as the two of you stand quietly next to each other.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Um… Sorry to make you wait. Maybe I should have planned to show up a little earlier…”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“No, no. It’s my fault. I wanted to be here before, but… there are so many people today. I didn’t expect this.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“It’s okay! Maybe we should find somewhere a little quieter. I think I saw a neat little coffee shop on the way here. We could stop in and have a drink.”<</Dialogue>>

Elena goes from staring at her feet to looking you in the eye, again relaxing at your suggestion.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Yes, I… I think that is good. Coffee is always nice.”<</Dialogue>>

After a few minutes of walking, you find yourself in the quaint little cafe. <<if $krisInterested is true>>Not too different from the one where Kris works, actually.<</if>> And it’s mercifully quiet, just as you had hoped. With minimal fuss, you decide to splurge on a fancy drink that probably has way too much sugar in it. Elena follows with a simple macchiato, then claims a table in the corner.

After that… an awkward silence. While Elena seems to be enjoying her coffee, she has been notably silent since she made her order. Her eyes are fixed firmly on the small coffee cup she is cradling in her hands. Maybe now is the time to start a conversation for her?
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“I hadn’t realized that you were a coffee fan.”<</Dialogue>>

Elena jumps a bit at that, her eyes rising to meet yours. After a moment of thought, a hint of a smile creeps onto her face.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“//Italiana//, right? I do enjoy it, I won’t lie.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“I guess my choice of drink might come out a bit offensive?”<</Dialogue>>

Elena lets out a quiet, almost inaudible laugh.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Not any more than the forced Italian names they use for sizes here. But you do you.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Well, I’d like to hear about what you like. I picked the coffee shop, so where are we going after this?”<</Dialogue>>

Another long pause from her. She looks down at her coffee cup again, though this time she looks more like she’s deep in thought. Eventually she opens her mouth and speaks softly.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Maybe we… No. No, never mind. You pick again.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“What? No, come on, really! You picked this neighborhood for this, you must know where the good shops are!”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“No, no. Really, I’m just happy to be here.”<</Dialogue>>

There’s another lengthy pause as you try to figure out how to respond. It feels Elena really does want to go somewhere specific, but… maybe she wouldn’t appreciate being prodded.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Come on! This is exactly the sort of way people on their first date get to know each other, bond with one another! I want to get to know you, so let’s go to wherever your heart desires!”<</Dialogue>>

Almost immediately, you see Elena clam up again. Her shoulders clench and raise, crowding against her neck and head. You can even see her hands trembling a bit, her coffee cup shaking silently. It seems that putting too much pressure on her gives her far more anxiety than you expected.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Er… Or we don’t have to! On second thought, I actually saw a cute little boutique we could look through!”<</Dialogue>>

At that, she eases up a bit. Still tense, just… a little less.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“//Va bene//, that sounds good. Maybe you lead the way today. I’m okay with going where you want.”<</Dialogue>>

You wince a bit. You can practically feel the nervous energy radiating from her.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“It’s all good. I’m more than happy to do that. I mean, speak up if you see a shop that draws your eye, of course, but… I’ll take charge!”<</Dialogue>>

The smile returns to her face again.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Let’s go when you’re ready.”<</Dialogue>>

After your last sip of coffee, the two of you exit the shop onto the street, the cool air of the late morning greeting you. The sidewalk is just as bustling as it was before you ducked in, and you can’t help but notice the two of you draw some stares as you enter the crowd again. Elena hunches her shoulders in an attempt to shrink down as small as possible, and quietly slips behind you. Sensing that she’s not faring any better than before your break, you quickly hustle ahead of her to the boutique.

You both take a deep breath as you slip through the shop door and find only a few people inside, none of whom pay you much mind.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Well, thank goodness. I’m glad this place is quiet. I saw some outfits in the window that looked so nice, I wouldn’t have forgiven myself if I didn’t pop in here.”<</Dialogue>>

Elena returns a silent nod, the faintest hint of a smile on her lips again.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“//Bene//. I’ll be here with you.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“What? Aren’t you going to check anything out?”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“...I do not think the clothes here… suit me.”<</Dialogue>>

You raise an eyebrow at that. Based on what you’d seen of her so far, she had nice taste in clothes. Is your own fashion sense really that off?

You sift through the stacks of clothing on display, Elena tagging along behind you, picking out a shirt and a pair of pants that strike your fancy. You bring them over to a mirror, hold up the shirt against yourself to get a feel for how it looks… and only then do you realize Elena’s meaning. The thing is absolutely miniscule on your frame. You’d be lucky to fit an arm all the way into it.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Ah… Right.”<</Dialogue>>

Elena responds with her miniscule smile again.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Yes, it… it’s hard to find clothes that fit these days.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Yeah… I actually forgot for a moment. I was just so stoked about this outfit that it was the only thing I could think of!”<</Dialogue>>
That actually elicits a quiet laugh from Elena.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“I understand. My change happened… more slowly. Than yours, I mean. Yours was very sudden. I feel like I’ve had some more time to… adjust.”<</Dialogue>>

<<if $carefreeCarefull > 0>>You go about replacing the clothes you had picked up as the two of you speak.
<<else>>You quickly hand the clothes over to an employee before turning your attention back to Elena.<</if>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“That reminds me. How did… all this happen? I mean, what are the odds that some lab accident ended up in both our fridges?”<</Dialogue>>

She squirms at that, and her voice drops to a whisper.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I, uh… I don’t know. I had reasons to start exercising, but this… this does not come from exercising. This is not normal.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Wow. So you really don’t know, do you? I mean, you very clearly like weightlifting, seeing as you had plenty to teach me. Do you think there’s something special about your body? Or maybe…”<</Dialogue>>

She begins to tense again, her eyes staring back at the floor.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“No. Please. I’m sorry, but it’s… I don’t want to talk about that now.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Oh? Uh, I’m sorry. I just… I thought that since we were… you know, seemingly in the same situation it might be a good idea to, like… talk things through. You know, kinda… commiserate with each other?”<</Dialogue>>

She shakes her head again, still unable to look at you directly.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Maybe we should go somewhere else?”<</Dialogue>>

Elena smiles again, nodding quietly.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Okay. I will let you lead, //sì//?”<</Dialogue>>

You think to yourself for a moment. Leading is not how you normally handle things. And yet… As shy as you are, Elena is clearly even more so. Maybe she needs this. And it’s not like it’s a big decision, right? You’re just picking stores that look interesting, right?

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Okay. I… I think I can do that.”<</Dialogue>>

“I, uh… I don’t know. I had reasons to start exercising, but this… this does not come from exercising. This is not normal.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Wow. So you really don’t know, do you? I mean, you very clearly like weightlifting, seeing as you had plenty to teach me. Do you think there’s something special about your body? Or maybe...”<</Dialogue>>

She begins to tense again, her eyes staring back at the floor.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“No. Please. I’m sorry, but it’s… not what I want to think about right now.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Oh? Uh, I’m sorry. I just… I thought that since we were… you know, seemingly in the same situation it might be a good idea to, like… talk things through. You know, kinda… commiserate with each other?”<</Dialogue>>

She shakes her head again, still unable to look at you directly.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I… I think we should go somewhere else.”<</Dialogue>>

:: Push Elena {"position":"1450,3000","size":"100,100"}
Elena’s sudden change was… concerning, to say the least. When you met her, you were thrilled to finally have someone who could understand what you were going through. Elena had to have been thinking the same thing, surely. Why else would you two have bonded so quickly?
The possibilities ran quickly through your head, until the obvious solution popped up. It was so clear! Of course Elena, as shy as she was, wasn’t going to come out and ask you for help. She needed you, but couldn’t bear to spit it out! It all made sense. This is going to be your moment, a happy albeit tearful memory the two of you will look back on fondly in the future. But you must act now, or the moment will be lost.

With a few long, quick strides you catch up with Elena, and you gently take her hand in yours. She looks startled as you do, but she finally looks at your face again, her eyes wide with panic. Now was your chance to tell her you were going to make things okay.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Elena… It’s okay. Whatever you’re keeping secret, you don’t have to! Whatever this is, I want to be there for you, I want to help you through it. But if I’m going to help you, I need to know what I’m helping you with.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“<<print $playerFirstName>>, please… you… this is not something I want to talk about.”<</Dialogue>>
You place both your hands around hers and hold it tightly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Come on, who out there is better suited to help you than me? We must have found each other for a reason. I want to help you, but you need to let me in.”<</Dialogue>>

Her eyes snap back to the ground, and she starts to slip away from you. Her voice drops to a near whisper.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Please. There is nothing you can do. I want to move on to something else. //Per favore//.”<</Dialogue>>

[[She needs your help. Push her further.->Bad End]]
[[You're pushing her too hard. Ease up.->Make-Up End]]


:: Date Progress {"position":"1550,3000","size":"100,100"}
You quietly contemplate Elena’s sudden change as you walk after her. Putting yourself in her shoes, you can understand the reason for her refusal. If most people… hell, probably anyone, had started pushing you about your condition, that would almost definitely make you bristle. Perhaps you had been a little too pushy with her.

With a few long, quick strides, you catch up to her and place a hand on her shoulder. She starts briefly, but turns to face you, her eyes wide with panic.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“It’s okay. I… I’m sorry. I know that this whole thing is a sensitive topic. So… you don’t have to tell me anything.<</Dialogue>>

It’s quiet for a moment. The conversation of the people walking around you seem to melt away for a moment as you simply stare into each other’s eyes. After many long seconds, Elena reaches a hand up and places it on yours, a soft smile again rising to her face.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“It’s okay. I… I know you are trying to help. //Grazie//.<</Dialogue>>

She gently rubs her hand across the top of yours. You stand there for a moment, enjoying the silence together.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“So… I take it I haven’t scared you off. What now? I can find us another shop to check out, maybe we grab some lunch…<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Actually… There is somewhere I would like to go. If that’s okay with you.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Of course it is! Why didn’t you say so earlier?<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I thought it would be… //come se dice//… imposing? I thought you would find it boring.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Hey. Don’t sweat it. If you’re going to enjoy it, I definitely don’t mind spending some time there myself.<</Dialogue>>

She gives you that same soft earnest smile before moving around you, so that your arm wraps around her back, turning your hand-holding into a sort of sidelong hug. It takes you a second to realize what’s happened, so gentle is her motion, but without even realizing it, she’s got your arm wrapped around her waist as you’re walking down the street. She’s still wearing her smile, despite the fact that she’s furiously blushing, and you can’t help but return in kind.

She guides you through the little town, taking several turns along the shop-lined streets, until you reach a flower shop. At first you’re confused, but Elena’s lit-up expression answers everything. She’s excited to visit here, even if she’s still hesitant to say it. She leads the way inside, giving a quiet hello to the little old man running the place before she starts looking along the shelves. You follow behind her, not sure whether you have anything to contribute as she questions the shopkeeper about some new arrivals.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“So… I take it this is a hobby of yours.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“I’ve always loved flowers. Ever since I was little. There was a flower shop a lot like this one where I grew up.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“In Italy, you mean?<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“//Sì//. I come here to buy new flowers, but also because it feels a bit like home.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Speaking of… if you don’t mind, how long ago did you immigrate?<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“I was young… Thirteen.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Geez. That’s a rough age to be starting life anew.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Yes… yes, it was. Half a world away with no friends… It was hard back then.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Probably being the shy kid didn’t help matters.<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Ah… actually, I wasn’t very shy at all before then. It was then when I tried to make new friends and it was always… you know, teasing… I kind of started to close off."<</Dialogue>>

As she speaks, her voice drops back into that shy, quiet register that you have grown accustomed to. She didn’t sound sad, but melancholic. Not as if this was painful for her to talk about, but more as if she was dwelling on a difficult memory. You decide to keep quiet for a moment, and simply allow her to talk as much as she’s comfortable. Meanwhile, Elena leans in to examine another plant, holding its petals delicately between her fingers.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“You asked me earlier how I got to be this way. Do you still want to know?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“You don’t have to tell me, really. If you don’t want to share, I’m not going to make you."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“It’s okay. I… just needed to take a deep breath. I feel good now. I want to share."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Only if you’re sure about it, Elena."<</Dialogue>>

She nods in return, giving you another faint smile, as if to reassure you she’s okay.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I tried to fit in better a few times when I was young. I kept trying to… reinvent myself, but they wouldn’t see me as anything but the weird girl. The foreigner. I tried a few different things hoping it would help them accept me… Sports, art, music, you know. But nothing really worked. Eventually, I thought I should start exercising. I had this idea that… if I got to be big and strong, then maybe that would give me confidence, but… I think you can tell that didn’t work."<</Dialogue>>

She gives a soft, breathy laugh. You can’t quite tell whether it’s genuine or one of self-pity.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“But the funny thing is, I fell in love with it. I started doing it for fun. I stopped caring so much what other people thought of me. And I was a lot happier for it. Then, I started to really grow up, and I started to feel better. I was actually feeling okay with myself for the first time in a long time."<</Dialogue>>

She sighs, then gestures to her body.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Then, about a year ago, this happened. I just… started to explode in size all of a sudden. And when that happened, I noticed people staring all the time, I heard people whispering about me… It felt like I was a teen all over again. And then… one day, you walked into the gym and I thought… hoped, I guess, that maybe you wouldn’t judge me. Maybe you would even understand what I felt."<</Dialogue>>

She stops and turns to you again, placing her hands on your arms.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I’m sorry. I feel like I’m talking too much. But… I realized it’s important. I wanted you to know."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Elena… I’m sorry. It sounds like this whole process has been hard on you. But I want you to know…"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“You’ve been nothing but great to me so far, and I want to be sure I return the favor. I don’t know how many friends you have now, but I count you as one of my closest friends. So no matter what, I’m helping you through this whole thing, one way or another.”<</Dialogue>>

Elena pauses for a moment, staring at your face. She seems almost surprised. But soon that gives way to a smile and a quiet sniffle.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Thank you <<print $playerFirstName>>. I… I do not have many people I usually count on. This… means more than I can express in words.”<</Dialogue>>

Suddenly, Elena wraps her arms around you in a tight, almost backbreaking hug, her face buried in your shoulder.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Grk… glad to help!”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Sorry! Sorry. It… It really does mean a lot.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“And I meant it. I’m by your side, a hundred percent.”<</Dialogue>>

You both stand there, embracing each other for what feels like the briefest eternity. Eventually, Elena stands back up to her full height and forces herself to let you go. She opens her mouth to speak, but is cut off by a chime from her phone.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“//Porca miseria//! It’s late already. I’m so sorry, I lost track of time. I need to go.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Ah, crap! I’m sorry, but I’ll see you at the gym, right?”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Of course! Goodbye, and thank you!”<</Dialogue>>

Before you can say anything more, Elena is grabbing her things and rushing out the door. Perhaps it was the right call to stay friends. After all, you have a good feeling you’re going to need each other.

<<link "Go home" "Home">><<addMinutes 180>><</link>>


:: Best End {"position":"1700,3125","size":"100,100"}
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“You are one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met. And I pity anyone who can’t see that through the fact that you look a little different.”<</Dialogue>>

She sniffles again, averting her eyes from you.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“This is not a little different. And besides, you don’t - ”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Come on. Look at me. We’re going through this together, and we’re going get over it together, one way or another. You and me against the world.”<</Dialogue>>

That causes her to jump back.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Come on, we’re practically made for one another. Have you ever seen a better power couple?”<</Dialogue>>

Her eyes dart back and forth, now suddenly nervous as she slouches again.
<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Well… I did agree to a date, right? I guess… If there is one person I would trust, it is you.”<</Dialogue>>

You hold her chin gently in your hand, and she looks you in the eyes again. You stand there, staring at each other for a quiet moment, before she suddenly throws her arms around you in a tight embrace. She buries her face in you, resting it in what space there is between your shoulder and neck, her arms clutching you in what feels like an attempt to snap you in half. After taking a moment to collect yourself, you return the favor, and hug her across her broad back.

After a long embrace, Elena is the one to break it off, wiping her eyes and collecting herself with a deep breath that makes her chest puff up even more.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“I’m sorry. That was… I don’t know what came over me.”<</Dialogue>>

You continue to hold her, with your hands resting on her forearms.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“It’s okay. It’s kind of a lot of emotion, all at once. It took a lot for me to not do that too.”<</Dialogue>>

She tries to restrain a laugh, but is interrupted by a chime from her phone. She quickly checks the alarm, which gets dismissed in a hurry.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Ah… Do you have anywhere to be today?”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“No, I should be free for the day.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Good. I think I am too.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Great! Because you’re picking our next spot. But before we leave here… I should probably be a lady and buy you a gift, how about that?”<</Dialogue>>

You quickly scoop up one of the flowers she was eyeing before she can protest, and wave it to the shop owner. She eyes it with curiosity. Her face breaks out into a grin.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“White chrysanthemum. Heh… Do you know anything about flower language?”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Uh… no? Is that a thing? I think I remember something from a book I read back in elementary, but I’m not sure.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Well… it’s about what different flowers mean when you give them to someone…”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Oh, boy. What does this one mean?”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">>
“Let’s say… that you think I’m adorable.”<</Dialogue>>

You can feel your face blushing, mirroring Elena’s. As you quickly pay for your purchase, you two of you leave the establishment, both fighting the urge to burst out into a fit of giggles, like a pair of silly teenagers. You don’t know what the future holds for either of you at this point, but you have a good feeling that there is nothing you can’t do with Elena by your side.

<<link "Go home" "Home">><<addMinutes 180>><</link>>


:: Bad End {"position":"1325,3125","size":"100,100"}
You refuse to let go, looking at her pleadingly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"Elena, please. Let me in. Whatever this is, it's not going to get better if you don’t accept other people’s help."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“No, I… This is not… Please, just leave it alone.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“You don’t mean that! Come on, I know this is hard. Let me help you!”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“Please!”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“Just tell me!”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“//BASTA!//”<</Dialogue>>

Elena’s voice booms out, louder than you had thought possible from her. You don’t know the word, but she clearly means ‘stop’. Everything around you seems to freeze, as does the crowd around you, staring at the two of you.

Her face is downcast again. She’s trembling, and her voice is muffled and shaky.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I… I do not think this is working. I think I should go home.”<</Dialogue>>

As she looks up at you again, her eyes shimmer with sadness.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
"This isn't working out."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
"But... can we stay friends at least? Workout partners?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
"I guess. I don’t know."<</Dialogue>>

It’s quiet. Painfully so. Elena has clearly said her piece, but… now the words are failing to come to you.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>
“I… I’m sorry.”<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>
“I know. Goodbye, <<print $playerFirstName>>.”<</Dialogue>>

With that, she turns and leaves. The crowd around you begins to move again, quietly murmuring about the brief spectacle. And you’re left standing alone. You silently kick yourself, wondering where everything went wrong. Whatever happens next with Elena, you know this; an apology is in order.

<<link "Go home" "Home">><<addMinutes 180>><</link>>


:: Make-Up End {"position":"1450,3125","size":"100,100"}
Slowly, silently, you let go of Elena's hand. Still riddled with indecision, you stumble over your words, attempting to figure out how to recover from this. As the words fail to come to you, you realize there's only one thing you can say.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Elena, I'm sorry. I was only trying to help, really."<</Dialogue>>

Elena takes some time to respond. You can see her chest heaving as she takes repeated deep breaths, slowly steadying out into normal.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> 
"I know. But this is not okay. I need... I need some //silenzio//. I need quiet. I need to relax."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Yes! Yes, of course! Why don't we head back to that coffee shop? We can get another coffee, or maybe some tea, maybe a snack, and it'll all be good!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> 
"No. No, I need to be alone. I... I'm sorry, but you are... a little too much right now."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Oh. I see. I'm sorry. You're right. That's probably for the best."<</Dialogue>>

You take a deep breath of your own and prepare to turn around and walk off, relegating yourself for some alone time of your own. Before you can leave, you can feel Elena's hand on your shoulder.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> 
"I'm not upset with you. Just so you know."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Huh?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> 
"//Forse um po//. Maybe a little. But... that's why I need the alone time. I need to... clear my head. Figure things out. We can figure out where we stand after that."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Okay. Maybe this date thing doesn't pan out. But can we still be friends? Gym buddies, at least?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">> 
"I suppose so. I don't think I could stop you from coming to the gym anyway."<</Dialogue>>

She cracks a tiny smile once again. All hope is not lost after all.

<<Dialogue "ElenaHappy" "Elena">> 
"So I will see you there."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> 
"Yeah. See you there."<</Dialogue>>

You wave goodbye as Elena turns to leave. You're left alone with your thoughts on the quiet back street. The date was... far from perfect. It's clear now that your personality doesn't mesh well with hers. Maybe a romance with her isn't in the cards, or maybe you need to be careful and gentler with her. Either way, you have a lot of thinking to do today, and plenty of time to do so. But there is yet hope. Elena is still your friend and who knows the future holds?

<<if $evenCenterVisited != true>><</if>>"You walk towards the vast convention hall, seeing the advert for a bodybuilding competition going on. You approached the wide double doors<<if $fat >= 80 | | $breasts >= 80 || $height >= 250 | | $muscle >= 80>>, trying to enter by squeezing yourself through. Man, if only you could make the door bigger somehow<</if>>. 

‘Anything less than strong’
Sure, you don’t exactly have much muscle mass to speak of, but surely it couldn’t hurt to peek? Hell, maybe you could even consider entering! Once you’re inside the hall however… oh… oh, God, no…  reality smacks you right in the face. Women and men with gigantic bodies, arms that seemed as wide as your lanky legs. You exit just as quickly as you walked in, face flush in pure embarrassment that such a silly idea could even cross your mind"

‘Strong’

As you enter the hall, you assume you’re in pretty good shape to entertain these thoughts. Sure, there’s some absolute behemoths of muscle on sight, but as far as the female side of things go, you seem like you might just give them a run for their money! You approach the registration desk and see that there’s a few different categories: Lightweight, middleweight, and heavyweight. Deciding that you weren’t THAT big yet, you opt to register for the lightweight category

‘Heavy’
Once inside, you catch the eye of a few people who gaze upon you for the first time. Being a nobody, you call attention with your decent build. Said gazes give you a slight boost of confidence as you approach the registration desk, deciding to enter the intermediate weight class

‘Bodybuilder
After you manage to shimmy your way into the building, you’re surprised at how the competition isn’t all that bad. Not only are you on par with them, size-wise, but also when it comes to definition. As you confidently mark yourself down in the middleweight category, you eye the larger contestants… and wonder what it must feel like to go on stage against them

‘Heroic’
As you strut inside, eyes quickly fall on you. How could they not? This random girl just popped in, on par with the largest female bodybuilders present. Seeing this, you decide to mark yourself down for heavyweight, seeing as anything less wouldn’t even be fair
‘Strongman’
Walking inside with a bit of difficulty, you nevertheless catch the eyes of the people gathered around. Your muscles are the envy of every female competing, and even some of the men

‘Sumowrestler’
After you force your way inside past the revolving door, you notice you there is already a small crowd assembled in your presence. It was inevitable, really, with your pecs having more mass than some of the smaller competitors present

‘Anything bigger’
The poor door was incapable of withstanding your mass, no matter how delicately you tried to squeeze in. As a result, said door gets demolished along with its corresponding frame, your colossal muscles unscathed. After you apologetically look back, you turn around to notice that a massive crowd has gathered at the entrance. Whether it was from your concrete-shattering steps or the shadow you cast over the entrance, you couldn’t say. But one thing was clear: All eyes are on you

<<addMinutes 15>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, doing well... just a lot going on, you know. With how expensive food is getting and all the issues with clothes not fitting and stuff... it’s a lot. But thank you for asking. How was your day?"<</Dialogue>>

You smile a bit, but Kris seems to be a bit shaken by this. She shifts from left to right, trying to get comfortable, before answering you. Her air of bravado has taken a bit of a hit; it seems she wasn't expecting you to actually converse with her.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Ehm, well, yeah, doing fine, I guess? Work is a hassle, as always, but fuck it, I need to make money, right?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"At the Coffee Corner, right? Is that your only job? Or do you have other gigs?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... Yeah. Well, the only work I do is on paper, if you catch my drift. Got to make ends meet, after all. But really, I fucking hate it and wish I could do something else."<</Dialogue>>

You listen to her, rather stunned. Kris is aggressively bored; she's not rude or anything, but she's keeps spitting out information with little thought. It seems she expected a different outcome for the question, but this is also the first time Kris is doing anything resembling opening up. Perhaps you could learn a bit more about her here.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... I've been meaning to ask. You don't seem to enjoy working in the Coffee Corner at all... Why did you even apply there?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"There is a gym nearby, and I got to see some nice and BIG people training there... hehehe... but come oooon, let's not talk about all this boring stuff when I got someone as amazing as you here! How about you give me a flex, big girl?"<</Dialogue>>

[[KrisTalk2<-Ask why she is so interested in big people]]

<<addMinutes 15>>You <<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>grin at her<<else>>wince somewhat uneasily<</if>>, flexing your bulging biceps at her. The effect is apparent as your muscles rise up and Kris's grin grows wider and wider. Her hand reaches out to touch, but <<if $submissiveDominant > 1>>playfully you slap it away.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Only good girls get the beef, and you're a VERY bad girl, keeping me waiting in this kind of place!"<</Dialogue>>

Taking a step closer, you stand across from her. <<if $height < 160>>Despite being smaller than her, you still manage to be the one in charge of the situation.<<elseif $height < 200>>You utterly loom over her, as Kris smiles at the display.<<else>>You loom over her, Kris grinning as she drink it in.<</if>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Hehe, Oh excuuuuuse me, princess! I didn't know I was dealing with a fragile snowflake instead of a fucking giant Goddess! Heh, but if you don't like this place... we can always go to my place."<</Dialogue>>

She adds a wink that is somehow less subtle than the rest of her attitude. Well, at the very least she's clear about her intentions. You COULD go to Kris's house and undoubtedly have a rather exciting evening... but you wouldn't get to know Kris better, or figure out the weird relationship you two have. What should you do?

[[KrisSex<-Go to Kris' place]]

[[KrisFlex<-Lets tone it down a bit, but be playful]]
<<else>> you wince a bit, visibly uncomfortable. You tried being playful, you tried taking the initiative, but you simply don't have it in you. Kris's hand moves forward, actually touching you and though she was about to say something way more provocative, she actually gazes at you for a bit.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... you good?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"S-sorry, I tried being a bit playful but just... this isn't me. C-can you... remove your hand, please?"<</Dialogue>>

You can feel the doubt in Kris. She is in charge, and she knows it. She can keep it there. But she's also seeing that you tried something, that it failed, and that you're uncomfortable. Her hand pulls away.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Heh, its cute how much you still have the personality of someone half your size. Guess that doesn't grow with the rest of you. I might even appreciate that."<</Dialogue>>

You wince a bit. Kris could control you so easily, and if you didn't stand up for yourself more, it would only get easier for her...

[[KrisPostTalk<- Talk about something]] <</if>>


:: KrisTalk2 [Done] {"position":"2200,2825","size":"100,100"}
<<addMinutes 15>>It feels odd, talking to Kris like this. It’s really different from what you two normally talk about; namely, your body. But it also allows you to get to know her. And as she clearly doesn't expect it, it keeps her off balance. Yet talking about big people pulled the old Kris back. 

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So you chose your work because... you like big people? Really?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>Haha, why not? Why else would I do it, for the tips?!?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, but...not many people choose a job so they can... ogle at people."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Yeah, and that's where I'm different. I do what I feel like doing. I don't CARE about that fucking job, and I refuse to pretend to enjoy. I got enough money to eat, that's all that matters right? I don't need some boring ass degree or soul-crushing 9 to 5, I got my passions, and SIZE is one of them! And I WON'T apologize for it!"<</Dialogue>>

She slams the table, reinforcing the statement. Her voice had risen a bit, her eyes even more intense than normal. You lean back, your <<if $muscle > 40 || $fat > 40>>broad <</if>>back pressed into the booth. Like a predator, Kris notices the moment of weakness, her knees on the table as she leans intimately close to your face. Her face is flushed, her breathing shallow as her nails scratch loudly against the wood.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh, you only realized it now? You wanted to know about my job? Well, before I go to work, I masturbate to big guys or girls, I fantasize about giants trampling cities, about them ramming their gigantic cocks against my body. At night, I dream about it, I buy the biggest dildos around so I can get a SENSE of that feeling. I want to bathe in their cum, be held on a leash by a fucking GOD of a human with muscles so obscene the fucking giant will have no choice but to grow bigger and bigger and UNGH! And YOU are going to be that for me!"<</Dialogue>>

Okay, Kris is in a mood. How the HELL are you going to deal with this?!

<<addMinutes 15>>Well, time to give her the goods, huh? You shuffle over a bit until you're sitting right next to her. Your meatier leg rubs against hers, and under the table you decide to flex it a bit. Huge quads explode outwards, and Kris' eyes widen at the display. <<if $muscle > 80>>They utterly dwarf her own legs, each head of the muscle dwarfing the tiny limb next to it.<<elseif $muscle > 50>> The comparison would be depressing if it was so enticing for her, and you can see Kris reacting wildly, like her blood is about to boil. Her hands drift over, stroking the little show you put on for her.<</if>><<if $dick >= 20>> The gigantic log between your legs catches Kris's attention next, and you see her willpower being tested as she fights her urges to go down on that thing right now. The fabric around it doesn't even hide the protruding glans. Heck, even the veins are at full display, and you bite your lips hoping to soften it a bit somehow.<<elseif $dick >= 10>> And of course, Kris's hands drift to the big, thick log between your legs. Without even asking, she gropes and caresses it, kneading the shaft a bit as she looks you dead in the eyes. Oh, she knows. And she no longer cares how it got there… only that it's big, and within reach. <<elseif $dick > 5>> Kris reaches out and kneads them, her hands traveling over the sinew. Her eyes are glued to your legs but... well, she can’t miss the that OTHER bulge there. Her eyes stick to it, seemingly trying to undress you before grinning like a maniac. Oh, she likes what she sees.<</if>> She quickly readjusts her position, sitting on your lap and facing you. <<if $height > 200>> Her face comfortably faces your pecs, and it’s obvious she’s loving every second of it.<</if>> With her legs over yours, she can now fully compare them, and also explore your torso to her heart’s desire. The chest, the breasts, her eyes wander aimlessly, and she is content as can be. <<if $submissiveDominant > 1>> However, when your eyes meet hers, you make it a point to assert you are still in charge. In response, Kris merely grins like the Cheshire cat, embracing that challenge. <<else>> Kris grins like the Cheshire cat, challenging you, but confident that she is the one in charge.<</if>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Damn, you're... amazing. Look at those muscles, those pecs, those... EVERYTHING! And we're going to make you even bigger!"<</Dialogue>>

She then leans forward, hands on your chest. Your faces are almost touching, and her lips nearly touching yours. You can feel her warm breath on your face. People look at you, and Kris’s lack of self-control, but she doesn't care. For all her faults, there is one thing she can never be accused of. Feeling ashamed of what she is. Her hands grope and knead, taking all of you in touch, with fingers so tiny and soft that she is closer to a pet than a peer. <<if $breasts > 50>>She's almost sitting between your cleavage, but who cares? Kris certainly does not.<<elseif $breasts > 30>> She's firmly leaning into your breasts, making them squish to the side.<</if>> Unable to control herself anymore, she begins leaning in. Her breath warms your neck, before unleashing soft nibbles, and then messy kisses. Her hips grind against yours, her torso rubbing against you as her hands try her hardest to wrap around you. With all fiery passion under her skin, she still shows a surprising amount of control and precision in every move, her hands never leaving your body. Your eyes open a bit, watching people staring at you and...

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... Listen is this a fucking date or the goddamn Spanish inquisition?!?"<</Dialogue>>

Well, you didn't expect that. But despite her protests, you get the feeling you can push further.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, come on, I just want to get to know you a bit better. Don't be like this."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Fine. You wanna know? Okay."<</Dialogue>>

She flags someone over for a couple of drinks, looking none too pleased. When her beer arrives, she slams it down in a single gulp.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... I am constantly harboring this raging libido, working a dead end-job and I have no relevant skills or anything better to do with my life. Okay?!? Happy now?"<</Dialogue>>

Kris taps her finger on the table nervously, looking away. Was that it? The reason Kris has this larger-than-life personality? Just chasing thrills because of a high libido and a lack of ambition? Or is this related to an insecurity over her lack of talent? Digesting all that leaves you in silence for a while. All the playfulness has been knocked out of Kris, and she just glares into the void.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... If I'm stuck at a dead-end job I might as well get something to masturbate to."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But... what about other hobbies?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Like what? The gym? Too much effort. Cooking? Eh, I don't eat much. So no, I don't have many other hobbies. I mean, right now, YOU are my hobby, heh!"<</Dialogue>>

Before that would sound creepy, but now it just feels kind of... depressing. Her bravado, this mask, it just covers this big empty hole inside of her.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"How about we try to find something for you to geek over? You know, on our next date?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Wait, wait, wait... you... want another date? After this... trainwreck!?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, because I'm finally actually getting to know you better."<</Dialogue>>

And with that, the spark ignited between the two of you. A moment of genuine softness between two women. Nonetheless, already you could see Kris going from surprise to her trademark smirk. Oh, no...

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Heh, I KNEW you were a big softy! Good to know, bi-... <<print $playerFirstName>>. But... sure. I'd like another date. If you are up to it."<</Dialogue>>

Though she relapsed a bit, and will probably put on a brave face again, you get the feeling that Kris has shown more of her true self here than she might have done in years. The two of you chat a bit more, have a few drinks, but finally decide it’s time to go.

<<addMinutes 15>>You decided to do nothing, and Kris takes her shot. Without any warning, she sits on the table and grabs your head, leading into the sloppiest kiss possible. With warm lips, she presses herself against you, leaving you little chance to react. Her lips smooch yours, Kris exploring you, inside and outside. They drifted over your <<lipsDescription>> lips, your cheek, before she gets lost in making out with you. Her tongue forces itself into your mouth as Kris moans sensually. <<if $height >200>>You might be much bigger than her, yet she is firmly in control here. She tastes you, as her moaning continues.<</if>><<if $tongue <= 2>>Her eyes open wide as she feels just how massive your tongue is in your mouth. Her tiny one explores yours, dancing around yours with exploratory intent. Her tongue hooks around yours, pulling it out while her teeth gently nibble it. She coaxes it out, her hand squeezing it with delight and curiosity.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"... Fuck, all of you is big... Perfection."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $tongue <= 4>>With the appendage still writhing in her hand, Kris takes the tip of your tongue into her mouth. Gently, she sucks on it, massaging it... almost like she's giving your tongue a blowjob! It goes deeper and deeper inside her, while you just watch, stunned, as she delights in the pleasure of having you inside her.
<</if>><</if>> Kris is now moaning louder across from you, giving in to pure delight. Her hands return to your shoulders, your pecs... every part she can find a sinewy curve, she has fingers on. Unashamed, she continues oblivious to her surroundings as she worships you nonstop, with increasingly loud groans and moans.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"... your body is a work of art. And you're only going to keep growing. You're my fucking dream, a fucking miracle, a world wonder, a - Hehe... Why am I even praising you? You know all this, don't you, bitch?"<</Dialogue>>

Geez, Kris was in a MOOD with a capital M. Quickly, you attempt a change of topic, trying to regain some footing.

<<addMinutes 15>>Gently, you push Kris away, trying to catch your breath and interrupt her horny groping for a second. As she sits next to you, again, you try to catch your breath, as you sweat and fight some slight panic.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"S-sorry! Just... you know... a lot of people watching..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Fuck, you're one of the most difficult lays I've had in a while... but okay, don't worry, I can wait, I can be patient! Heh, I will treat this like my personal game of cat and mouse!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Yeah, DUH. You're playing hard to get! I’m the cat in this scenario."<</Dialogue>>

You were perhaps a bit playful, but it wasn't a game to get laid. This date was a means to get to know her, wasn’t it?

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Aw, come ooooon, don't play coy! You can be straight with me."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>I'm not playing hard to get!"<</Dialogue>>

Her eyes display confusion for a second as her mind tries to process this information. You can see it enter her brain, the gears grinding with unease, and yeah, the message is not coming across. You need to do SOMETHING to make Kris get it.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... But I LIKE the games."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, well, me too, but not ALL the time, you know? "<</Dialogue>>

Your voice broke a bit, your frustration surfacing. Kris looks at you in stubborn silence.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... Well? I wanted this to be a fun night out, Kris!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Same here, duh! Guess I misread the room a bit. Okay. Eh... give me a moment."<</Dialogue>>

Kris paces around a bit, thinking. Around you, the pub still buzzes with activity, like a beehive of lewdness, music and alcohol.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"Right. I'll try to be more aware of the situation. How does that sound?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"... That is all I am asking."<</Dialogue>>

Guess this is all you are getting for now. Kris is still eating you with her eyes, admiring your bulk… but at least she is displaying SOME restraint. Keyword being ‘some’.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"See? We can have fun! Listen, beefcake, I had a ton of fun this evening. And I'll try to be a bit more open in the future, okay? Look, I can confidently say I enjoyed myself tonight, I hope you did too! Can I get a hug now or what?!?"<</Dialogue>>

She opens her arms, and you reluctantly embrace her. She squeezes tight, and you could swear you heard a tiny grunt. After letting go, she smiles at you.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"We'll do WONDERFUL things together, mark my words... so… until next time?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, sure."<</Dialogue>>

Kris walks off, blowing you a small kiss. Well, tonight wasn't a total bust. But it wasn't a great success either. Kris just seems so obsessed with your body that she barely pays any attention to the person within. As you walk home, you wonder where things will go from here, and what the next date with her will be like. You just know you haven’t seen the last of Kris.

It didn’t matter if you were <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>three meters or a meter and a half tall<<else>>ten feet or four feet tall<</if>>, hugely muscled or thin as a stick. She was going to listen. As it finally comes across, you take a step closer to make sure she listened.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"… Roger that. I… will try to behave."<</Dialogue>>

In an attempt to deescalate things bit, you lean in, smile, and give her a warm hug.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"That is all I am asking. Now, this was a fun evening, and I hope you also enjoyed yourself. I will see you later, okay?"<</Dialogue>>

<<addMinutes 15>>Outside of the bar, you stare at each other, Kris fighting to regain her composure. You can clearly see she just isn't used to this, nor does she want it. She clearly expected hot steamy sex, but instead was forced to open up emotionally. Looking at her, it's strangely sweet how much she tries to maintain that alpha façade. Her effort, however, demands a small reward.

<<if $submissiveDominant < 0 || $shyConfident>>With shaking hands<<else>>With confidence<</if>> you lean forward, and give Kris a contained and affectionate kiss. Your lips touch her cheek, and Kris instantly stops her rambling and stares at you like you just grew a second head. 

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"The fuck was THAT for?!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Just... a small kiss. Because I appreciated this time we had together, and I was very glad we talked like friends. I... I enjoyed that. A lot."<</Dialogue>>

Normally, Kris freaks you out with her intensity, but that feeling was gone now. Instead, There’s this tingling excitement you get as you look at her. You glimpsed into her madness a bit, you get her passion. You also realize that she isn't that crazy, she just... lacks focus. Kris, on the other hand, looks almost uncomfortable in her confusion.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... You do realize I just want to fuck you, right?"<</Dialogue>>

Utter silence. Was she trying to claw back into her alpha-bitch persona? Or was she trying to get a reaction out of you? Or... was she genuine trying to get her point across?

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... Sorry. This is all... new to me. Heh... I guess it's a lot easier to just ogle and admire and not... talk to people. Just... I don't mean it that... badly, okay?

She tries smiling, and it’s clear she's being sincere. She's TRYING, she just utterly lost and unsure how to do it.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I get it, really. Just don't be an ass ALL the time, can you do that?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasual" "Kris">>"... I'll try. I promise. And... fine. Listen... I... Uh... I guess... thanks for... tonight. It was good getting to know you."<</Dialogue>>

While blushing deeply, Kris leans in, and kisses you softly. With a melancholic smile, she walks away, waving you off. Well... that was quite a rollercoaster of a date. But all in all, it seems that Kris isn't so bad as she might come off initially. Even though she has some trouble acknowledging it.

You gulp, chest filled with uncertainty. Kris claims that she'll try to adapt... but when it comes to her, it’s always so hard to tell. And yet, she still somehow surprises you: leaning forward, she hugs you. <<if $muscle > 50 || $fat > 50 || $breasts > 50>>Her arms barely go around you. <</if>> While normally this would be just horny groping, this is actually a very affectionate and warm hug, and she lets go without any protest.

As you try to sit down on your chair, your arms are squished and your considerable bulk makes the poor piece of furniture groan under you. Before you drop your weight, you hear a cough behind you. Startling you, you shift your weight fully to one of the arm-rests and it breaks clean off, sending you to the floor with a loud thud.

Emma stands over you, barely showing any surprise.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Uh, are you okay? I... Let's take this to my office, please."<</Dialogue>>

Extending her hand, she helps you up, with surprising ease. The two of you walk to her office, the door closing behind her.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Actually, the reason I called you... is because of this. You obviously work out a LOT. And, we're noticing that our office supplies are a bit... well, insufficient for someone of your stature. However, an opportunity has come up! You see, we have a shipping facility in this building. However, some new city ordinances have precluded us from operating the forklifts in the basement... so our operation is at a complete standstill while we figure this out. While your performance at my department is undeniable, I think this new setting might be a perfect fit for your… unique physique!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Right... so what about my pay? And hours?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Simple. There wouldn’t be many major changes, though the hours are more flexible. As for your wages, we will pay you per pallet shipped. You get a great workout, and your performance is dictated by your capacity for lug heavy cargo. You will still have to log your hours and make sure the shipping manifesto is up to date. So there is some admin work behind your PC, and for the rest of the day it would be just you and a whole lot of heavy goods to be moved. Would that be acceptable?"<</Dialogue>>

And you could make quite a hefty bonus if you move a lot of cargo. Well, with that settled, just make your way to the underground warehouse, the entrance is next to the canteen and... well, the signs there will instruct you about the shipping procedures! That's it."<</Dialogue>>

It's late afternoon, and you sit behind your computer plugging away at your daily work when you see Emma walk through the office. But not just walking. Moving quickly, eyes locked forward, brow more furrowed than normal. She makes a beeline through the office, people parting in front of her as she heads straight from her enclosed office to the break room. For a moment, you thank your good luck that she wasn't looking for you. The look on her face means that whoever she is currently thinking about is in trouble.

Then the break room door opens again and Emma steps through, a full coffee cup in hand. She speedwalks back through the office, only to pause as she reaches your desk.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Miss <<print $playerLastName>>."<</Dialogue>>
You freeze, unsure how to respond to the situation.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Uh, yes?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Please come to my office as soon as you finish what you're currently working on. I need to speak with you."<</Dialogue>>
Without waiting for a reply, she marches off again. The deafening silence surrounding you and several pairs of eyes trained directly at you don't help you feel any better.

You wrap things up as quickly as you can and head back to Emma's office, knocking on the door and opening it just enough to look inside. Emma sits behind her desk, one hand holding her coffee mug as she takes a long sip, the other clacking away at her keyboard as fast as it's able.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Ah. Come in, please."<</Dialogue>>
She sets her coffee down and gestures for you to the seat opposite her before pushing her keyboard away a bit and massaging the bridge of her nose.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Thank you for coming to see me, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I have something very urgent and important that I need to discuss with you."<</Dialogue>>
<<if $muscle>=90||$breasts>=100>$fat>=70||$height>=400>>You gander at the wooden chair that looks comically small next to your frame, and you know better than to sit in it. You stand in place, waiting anxiously to hear what Emma has to say.<<elseif $muscle>=50||$fat>=50||$breasts>=80||$height>=300>>You obediently take your seat, though its groaning doesn't make you any less worried.<<else>>You quickly take the seat and wait with bated breath to hear what Emma has to say.<</if>>You're still not sure if you were being hauled in here to be reprimanded.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Uh. Of course. Whatever it is, I'm happy to help?"<</Dialogue>>
Emma sighs and her shoulders slump a bit, but her serious expression remains unchanged.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Before I say anything, know that I chose to share this with you out of professional respect. Both for your abilities and your work ethics."<</Dialogue>>
You nod quietly, still unsure where this is going. Before long, Emma sighs again, but this time her expression softens a bit. For the first time you see her as something other than a stern authority figure. She looks tired.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I need your help."<</Dialogue>>
The words sound almost labored as she utters them. You stay quiet for a moment, unsure how to respond. Or what she's getting at, even.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "To be perfectly frank with you, I have a critical assignment here that needs to be done today, and I'm beginning to worry that that it just isn't going to happen under my own power. That's why I asked you here. It would be very helpful to me personally if you could stay late today in order to help finish this report."<</Dialogue>>
She leaves it at that, hands folded on her desk, looking at you for an answer. Can you devote your evening to some more work? Do you want to?

[[I'd be happy to help!|Date Accept]]

<<addMinutes 600>><<set $emmaDateProgress to 0>><<set $emmaDateFlirty to 0>><<set $emmaDateProfessional to 0>><<set $emmaDateFriendly to 0>>A look of relief washes over Emma's face as you acquiesce to her request.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Thank goodness."<</Dialogue>>
She turns her attention back to her computer, clicking on a few things and tapping away at the keyboard.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I'm printing off an extra copy of the most important information now. If you could, please grab it and come back here so we can get down to business."<</Dialogue>>
The rest of the day flies by as you and Emma buckle down, crunch numbers, and prepare a presentation. You dutifully rush between her office, your computer, and the office printer even after everyone else has left the building. Finally, hours after you should have been home, Emma heaves a sigh of relief and leans back in her desk chair.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "And with that. I believe we are done. Thank you again, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Without your help, I probably would have worked straight through the weekend to finish this."<</Dialogue>>
As she speaks, you turn to the office window. You can see that the sun has almost completely set. The very last purple-orange tinges of dusk are just poking up above the horizon.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Yeah. It looks like we both missed out on our evenings. Still, no regrets."<</Dialogue>>
Only as you finish saying this, your tummy rumbles, and you realize how hungry you are. The inevitable result of working through dinnertime, apparently. As Emma rises from her desk, you can hear her give a quiet grunt and put a hand to her abdomen. Apparently, she is in full agreement.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Well, we both busted our ass to get this finished. Why don't we celebrate? We could go out and grab some dinner together, maybe?"<</Dialogue>>
She cocks an eyebrow at you, her face quickly adopting a familiar stern expression.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Miss <<print $playerLastName>>, you would do well to remember that fraternizing with your superiors is frowned upon, for obvious reasons. While I am immensely grateful for the help you gave me today, I should hope you aren't entertaining any silly ideas."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Who said anything about fraternizing? I just want to spend some quality time with my awesome boss!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Let me be perfectly clear here: I take my commitment to this job very seriously, and courtship with other employees is not something I am willing to entertain - it would compromise my responsibilities in a way I am not at all comfortable with."<</Dialogue>>

You get the impression Emma is speaking from experience - there was a bitter edge when she said that. It gives you an uneasy sense of dread, but at the same time, it also stirs something inside of you, wanting to reach out for the person you feel she is shielding inside.

[[No, not at all! This is just dinner among coworkers. You could consider it a bonding activity.|Professional Start]]
[[Why does it have to be romantic? I consider you a friend by now. I just wanted to get a chance to know you better.|Friendly Start]]

:: Date Decline {"position":"850,3400"}
Emma pauses with a slow sigh, rubbing her temple as she slumps in her seat.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I suppose that's fair. It was a big ask, and sudden, too. I apologize for imposing like that."<</Dialogue>>
Her face quickly returns to the stoic, serious expression that she’s famous for. Her focus is immediately back on the task at hand. You take this as your cue to leave, awkwardly shuffling out of Emma's office and back to your workstation.

You feel out of your depth, suddenly worried about how much Emma is going to spend on your meal. But before too long, she leads you to a smaller, nondescript building.

<<addMinutes 60>>Before long, you're attended to by a cheery waiter. You only realize as he approaches that you've been so busy talking that you haven't even taken a single glance at the menu. You quickly grab it and speedread through your options as Emma addresses the server.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Why don't we split some arancini as an appetizer, and I will have the soup of the day with the chicken Florentine. $playerFirstName, do you have any preferences?"<</Dialogue>>
You quickly scan through the options, trying to remember your etiquette while you decipher dishes you've never heard of, and keep an eye on Emma's reaction, all at once.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Ahhh! I suppose I'll have the same thing she’s having!"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Hmm. A sensible choice."<</Dialogue>>
And a safe one. You figure it is better not to get something overly pricy. And maybe it would be endearing to follow her lead? That’s your hope, at least.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Oh. I know you're probably done with work for the day, but I just had a thought that I wanted to run by you. May I?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Oh, please! Go ahead."<</Dialogue>>
Emma reaches into her jacket pocket to retrieve a pen, then begins jotting her thoughts down on her drink napkin as she speaks. You nod along and respond when you're able. For a moment, it seems like she's more talking to herself than to you, as many of her musings involve business jargon that are go right over your head. Before you get too bogged down in her rundown of the day's affairs, your waiter returns with the appetizer that Emma previously ordered.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Ah, perfect. These are one of my favorites."<</Dialogue>>
You give the dish a quick poke with your fork. As far as you can tell, they are nothing more than fried dough balls.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "What are these again?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Rice and cheese, fried in bread crumbs. Classic combination, but a guilty pleasure we can all indulge in from time to time, right?"<</Dialogue>>
She forks one of the dumplings, and takes a bite, which steams discreetly, revealing the rice inside. With closed eyes, Emma lets out a pleasurable but dignified moan as she chews very slowly.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Doesn't exactly seem like healthy food, though. <<if $fat >= 50>>I mean, it's not like I'm going to scoff at it, but...<</if>> Are you sure you're not going to ruin that sculpted physique of yours?"<</Dialogue>>
Emma simply shrugs.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Thirty extra minutes on the treadmill tomorrow are but a small price to pay for this experience."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Is that a guesstimate, or are you actually counting your calories here?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Oh, I keep close track of my nutritional intake as well as my heart rates, and I make sure to do my research on any meal before I order it."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Wow. I'm impressed, but I'm starting to get the feeling you never take a break."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "What do you mean?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "I mean, you seem to have turned exercising and eating into a science. You apparently worked yourself into a corner at work and even now you're still thinking about it. I mean, talk about the stereotype of a workaholic!"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I will give you that point, that is not totally inaccurate. I do tick all the boxes. But I wouldn't classify it as an addiction. Think of it more as my natural state of being."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Now I'm lost."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Simple. I'm at my happiest when I'm busy. When I have a project to work on, or a goal to work towards. It's less working myself to the bone and more indulging on my core drives. You don't get to climb the career ladder unless you're labelled a ‘workaholic.’ You don't achieve peak fitness unless you're labelled a ‘workaholic.’"<</Dialogue>>
To punctuate her point, she lifts an arm into a flex and pulls the sleeve taut. Despite the fact that her arm isn't actually exposed, you can clearly make out the steely peak through the fabric.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Well, it's hard to argue with the results <<if $muscle >= 60>> Even if I feel like I can give her a run for her money<</if>>."<</Dialogue>>
<<if $muscle >= 60>>You laugh, your prominent chest and shoulders bouncing with the movement.<</if>>Emma responds with a satisfied smirk.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I'm glad you agree."<</Dialogue>>
Before you even know what's happened, the two of you have polished off the appetizers and your main courses have arrived. There's another quiet moment as you both dig into your meals.

Emma pulls some cash from her handbag to pay for the meal, but stops cold as she looks into her purse. You hear her mutter something under her breath.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Something wrong?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Somehow, I managed to leave my house keys in the office. I hate impose even more after everything you've already done today, but would you mind accompanying me back there? I'd feel better having someone else this late at night."<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">> "Of course! Come on, let’s not waste any time."<</Dialogue>>
You and Emma leisurely stroll back the way you came, the streets surprisingly quiet in the cool night air. It's unusually quiet. You can't quite think of what to say anymore, despite the fact that you feel like you know Emma better than you ever expected to. But even if the words aren't coming, you know very well how you feel about her after tonight.

You reach the front of the office building and Emma stops.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "Thank you again, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I enjoyed this time together."<</Dialogue>>

Somehow, you managed to catch Emma off guard. She had gone for a sip of water right as you chose to speak, and she just barely managed to avoid choking on her drink. She quickly makes her best attempt to recover.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">> "I had fun tonight, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I truly did. And if circumstances were different, maybe things could further develop from there.

The two of you head over to Kris’s place, where she immediately begins taking off her clothes. <<if $shyConfident > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Heh, can’t wait to get right to the point, huh?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh you know it, sexy. Get that sizzling body ready, because I want to feel aaaaaaaaaaaall of it"<</Dialogue>>

You smirk, taking it one step further, just ripping your clothes off your body. <<if $dick > 60>> You decide to get the posing action started right away, and instead of ripping out your pants with your hand, you flex your lower body to make your pants explode out from under you… including your dick. That anaconda of veiny flesh released from its fabric prison, pulsating freely, causes you to moan softly as a result <<elseif $dick > 30>> As you did, your dick proudly flops down from its cage, its veiny length hitting your quad with a satisfying smack. <</if>>
<<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"K-Kris... w-w-what are you doing?!"<</Dialogue>>
Kris looks at you with a raised eyebrow, hands on her hips
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"What? It’s my fucking place, isn’t it? Why the hell can’t I strip down? Come on, sexy, show me that hot ass bod!"<</Dialogue>>

Sheepishly, you take off your clothes, taking your sweet time to combat your shy nature. <<if $dick > 60>> As you slowly take off your pants, you instinctively try and hide the massive bulge that was barely being constrained by your undies. It’s futile, however. The veiny length was simply too massive to be anything but in-your-face obvious. <<elseif $dick > 30>> As you did, your dick proudly flops down from its cage, the veiny length hitting your quad with a satisfying smack while you give off a sheepish smile. She did say it was ok, after all. <</if>><</if>>


Shortly after, you begin flexing for her. Unsure of where to start, you figured you might as well go for a classic and flex your <<if $muscle > 70>> colossal <<elseif $muscle > 50>> huge <<elseif $muscle > 30>> big <<else>> decent <</if>> biceps. Doing so only causes Kris to lick her lips and fondle her breasts in anticipation.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh, yeah… come on… flex those puppies for me… make them bigger…"<</Dialogue>>


You smirk, seeing how Kris was putty in your hands. You decide to slowly pump your biceps bigger and bigger, licking the <<if $muscle > 70>> overinflated beach ball of a <<elseif $muscle > 50>> pumpkin-shaped <<elseif $muscle < 30>> melon-sized <<else>> lemon-sized <</if>>mound slowly across its peak. Whilst you licked your right peak, you flex your left bicep with the slowest yet most grueling pump imaginable. Your effort was rewarded by Kris’s enthusiasm as she crawled over to your feet. <<if $muscle > 50|$breasts > 50>> Kris’s line of sight, however, is blocked by your massive chest <<if $dick > 50>>, not to mention her face being pressed right up to your pendulum of a dong <</if>><</if>>

Kris licks your <<if $muscle > 20>> chunky <<elseif $muscle > 30>> tree trunk <<elseif $muscle > 50>> roman column shaming <<elseif $muscle > 70>> baobab dwarfing <</if>>legs, feeling the ropey muscles with her tongue in pure bliss. You yourself enjoy the sensation quite a lot, biting your lip as you feel the barista worship every inch of your body.


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Mmmmmm… you like this, don’t you? All this mass?"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>" YES, YES, YES, YES, YES. Don’t you dare fucking stop, flex as hard as you can for me! I won’t rest until you are all sweaty and exhausted from this flexing!"<</Dialogue>>

Delighted by the response, you turn around and have your back facing Kris, resting your hands at the sides of your hips and extending your lats. <<if $shyConfident < 1>>Said action helps dissipate that earlier shyness, though the combination of her compliments and utter adoration of your body does wonder to bring you a bit more out of your shell. <</if>> <<if $muscle > 60>> It was hard to imagine your lats becoming even larger, given how they are already so bloated that your arms are constantly angled nowadays. Alas, you made it possible. Your back extended, like a basketball field getting promoted to a damn aircraft carrier. So colossal are the muscles that make up your back, that one can trace a ridge between your upper back and your lower back. Kris could’ve put her hands against them as if they were a shelf. Which she gladly does. Every slight movement makes the sinew shift, an entrancing ballet of bulk <<elseif $muscle > 40>> As your back spreads out like wings, you can almost hear Kris drooling over the myriad of bulges making themselves known. Each muscle group is proudly visible, nay, they are bulbs ripe for picking by Kris’s eager and sweaty palms.<<elseif $muscle > 20>> Your back is a veritable anatomy chart, each muscle clear to see as they shift into position, your lats spreading out like a cobra, ready to strike.<</if>>

Kris wasn’t just enamored; she was in heaven. Immediately, she jumps at you, feeling and licking every bump and crevice along your back.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"YES! HOLY FUCK, THIS IS AMAZING!"<</Dialogue>>

<<if $shyConfident < 1>> Acknowledging Kris with your senses, her weight on back, makes you drop any pretense of shame you still held to. <</if>> You smirk and roll your shoulders, whilst Kris worships you like a goddess, waves of muscle shifting and bursting for the barista to fawn over.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Get down for a second, let me turn around"<</Dialogue>>


Kris doesn’t even hesitate to obey. After all, if it involved even more glorious girl beef, who was she to deny herself such luxury?
Once you feel her climb down, you turn around and face Kris directly, your worshipper dutifully at your feet. Your <<if $muscle > 20>> sizable <<elseif $muscle > 30>> huge <<elseif $muscle > 50>> man-shaming <<elseif $muscle > 70>> barrel sized <</if>> chest heaves as you begin to form a slick sheen of sweat from your flexing efforts. However, Kris was clearly not the only one enjoying herself. You yourself feel amazing showing off your gains, a small but noticeable smile of pure ecstasy adorning your face. Next, you decide to put your hands behind your back, giving Kris a front view of the lats that she had been holding on before. The barista was half tempted to jump right ahead and grab onto those wings, but her focus immediately shifts as you proceed to crunch your abs with a twist. Of course, with your pecs<<if $breasts > 50>> and boobs <</if>> being what they are, you also need the extra little step of lifting them out of the way so that your armored core can truly be appreciated. 
<<if $muscle > 20>> Your well-defined abdominals bunch forward as they press against each other. Each one looks as if it had been carved out of pure granite, glimmering in the room thanks to the light sheen of sweat caused by your impromptu routine. Kris couldn’t resist but prod these bricks, putting her fingers between the crevices of your six-pack, as she slowly kisses them in pure adoration. You feel beyond elated, the love that Kris is pouring onto your physique is truly intoxicating <<elseif $muscle > 40>> The eight muscular bricks surge forward, fighting for space, larger than any bodybuilder, male or female. Veins crawl from your hips up the various shimmering crevices of your stomach, even up the cluster of obliques that dot your sides. Kris being Kris, couldn’t resist and caresses this sweaty mountain range as she practically plasters her face against your abs.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>" Mmmm… yes… that’s the shit… this can’t get any be-"<</Dialogue>>


And just when she thought it couldn’t get better… you prove her wrong. You begin to shift your stomach back and forth, making our abs grind against each other, compress, expand, making them come alive. The barista utters a lusty moan <<if $breasts > 50>>, which is all you need in lieu of actually seeing her <</if>>. You smile and blush in return, this display of affection emboldening you to take it one step further.
 <<elseif $muscle > 70>> As you crunch down your abs, and Kris is forced to move her face away lest she be smacked by 10 bloated meat bricks. Your abs are indistinguishable from actual bricks as far as size and toughness are concerned. The barista gawps in wonder, witnessing creases form in the overdeveloped masses as they each clash for space with the other muscles between them. So massive is your core that it protrudes like a gut.


<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"… Wha… how… holy shit…"<</Dialogue>>

You smirk, basking in her sheer disbelief. And yet, you are just getting started. You begin swaying your stomach from side to side, your abs contracting and expanding in a hypnotic dance of pure mass. Even your obliques were bigger and more defined than other bodybuilders’ six packs! Of course, Kris couldn’t resist the urge to moan loudly as she rushes at the shifting muscles, licking the fat veins that cover your midsection like thunderbolts. She tries to stick her fingers in the spaces between each muscle themselves, but even Kris can tell that their sheer power might be able to break her phalanges. Your smile persists, as you prepare yet another trick you have in your sleeve.



<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Heh, just you wait, you’re going to love this"<</Dialogue>>
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"As if this could get any - "<</Dialogue>>


Kris is immediately proven wrong. Her jaw drops as she witnesses your abs wiggling like a wave. With all this mass on you, muscle control comes second nature to you. Your core shifts, an ocean of unrelenting muscle, in a hypnotic dance of sheer muscularity! You turn to the side, and continue with your performance, the monolithic stomach accentuated by the fat pulsating veins framing them.<</if>>
Kris was in utter bliss at the show you put for her. Your muscles shimmer in the soft glow from the window, making your body even more enticing to the barista. She licks, gropes, and all around explores your body in every way imaginable, eventually grinding her nether regions against your sizable legs. Both of you groan and moan, sheer pleasure bubbling to the surface, as Kris proceeds to lick the <<if $muscle > 50>> canyons <<else>> crevices <</if>> in between every muscle group in your beefy body. She slowly begins trailing up to your chest and arms, though you have a better idea. One last trick to finish the night with a bang.


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So, tell me Kris… I know you like them big… but how big is ‘too big’?"<</Dialogue>>



<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"<<if $muscle < 50>> ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? THERE IS NO SUCH THING. AS BIG AS POSSIBLE. I WANNA WALK TO THE MOON ON YOUR TRAPS, <<print $playerFirstName>>! YOU’RE SO FUCKING MASSIVE! I NEED YOU TO KEEP GROWING, BITCH, I WANT YOU TO BE AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING MONSTER!!! <<elseif $muscle > 50>> BITCH, PLEASE, YOU’RE A GODDAMN MONSTER ALREADY! A BLOATED BALL OF SEXY FUCKING BEEF, I DARE YOU TO GET BIGGER THAN THIS!<</if>>"<</Dialogue>>

Jackpot. Now you knew just how to end this. Just as Kris was crawling towards your upper body, you softly lower her with a single finger, adjusting your feet to get ready for the display that was to come.
<<if $muscle <= 20>> You move your arms under your chest, clasp your hands together, and FLEX. Your entire upper body bunches up and surges outward, making your already decent musculature seem obviously large. Veins pop up along your arms and neck, filling the wanting muscles with blood, with even a hint of them making themselves known alongside your chest. 
You smile down as you notice the reaction you were going for: Kris’s eyes, wide like saucers, she immediately jumps on and buries her face into your chest. This leads you to squeeze as much effort as you can muster into it, your face going red as your arms tremble with exertion. This goes on for a whole minute, until an erotic shudder coming from Kris causes the two of you to stop cold. The barista detaches herself, reaching down into her legs, only to smirk as she confirms it.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>" Heh, I guess I was enjoying myself a little too much there. Just… UNFF, that beef is always a good time!"<</Dialogue>>

<<if $shyConfident < 1>> You blush furiously as you realize what had just happened, averting Kris’s gaze as you rub the back of your head.


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>" Ummm, w-well I’m glad you e-enjoyed yourself!"<</Dialogue>>

Kris smirks, licking her finger seductively as she refuses to break eye contact.
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh, I’d say I more than enjoyed myself, <<print $playerFirstName>>"<</Dialogue>>


Too flustered by the outcome of what transpired, you quickly rush to grab all your clothes and head to the bathroom to get changed. Kris, meanwhile, simply sits down in the couch and enjoys the afterglow of the whole experience. 
<<elseif $shyconfident > 1>> You smirk as your think about what that implies. Did… did Kris pleasure herself while thinking of you? Not that it mattered, right know your just felt remarkably good. A boost of confidence like no other, it almost makes you want to go work out right away to keep on growing. <</if>>

<<elseif $muscle > 20 && $muscle < 70>> 
You move your arms under your chest whilst making your hands into fists, clasping them together under your chest and FLEXING. Your body, already large, becomes utterly massive as you perform a mind-boggling crab flex, smiling as you lean down for Kris to see. Veins crawl all along your upper body, from your neck to your chest to your arms and even down to the upper area of your abs, as your pecs clash for space with your arms.

Kris immediately jumps and opens her arms wide to feel every inch of your bloated mass. Alas, she is incapable of entirely wrapping her arms around your wide frame, though she is still content with whatever she can reach. She shudders and moans as she feels your muscles twitch and tremble with all the effort you put into flexing them. <<if $boobs > 50>>Whilst squishy and soft, the size of your boobs don’t help Kris, pushing her back.<</if>>

You smirk as you realize you have Kris under your thumb. Deciding to mess with the barista a bit more, you bounce your pecs in unison, as your muscles rub against her lithe body, veins surging forward and covering each of your meaty slabs. You squeeze a bit extra out of the flex as your chest continues to press against your arms, until…

Kris doesn’t even try to suppress it. This elicits a loud moan, and her legs become slick as she slowly peels off from your body and drops to the floor
<<if $shyconfident < 1>> You blush furiously as you realize what just happened, averting Kris’s gaze as you rub the back of your head.


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ummm, w-well I’m glad you e-enjoyed yourself!"<</Dialogue>>


Kris smirks, licking her lips seductively as she looks up at you, no attempt to cover what just happened down there. ‘Shame’ isn’t really in her vocabulary.
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh, I’d say I more than enjoyed myself, <<print $playerFirstName>>"<</Dialogue>>

Too flustered by the outcome of this little venture, you quickly rush to grab all your clothes and head to a bathroom to get changed, inevitably having to squeeze yourself through the doorframe. Kris, meanwhile, simply sits down on the couch and basks the afterglow of the whole experience. <<elseif $shyconfident > 1>> You smirk as you see the results of your labor, chuckling to yourself as a lecherous grin spreads on Kris’s face. This felt so fucking amazing. And to think… you weren’t even done with your show! <</if>>

<<elseif $muscle >= 70>> You smirk as you expand your arms outward, with your lats surging like a cobra’s hood. Veins proudly come to the surface, a testament to your musculature. Then, slowly, you begin lowering your arms in an agonizingly slow but powerful crab flex, teasing Kris endlessly.

<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>" COME ON, FLEX ALREADY, I WANT TO SEE YOU FUCKING EXPLODE!"<</Dialogue>>
You wink, knowing you had her under your thumb all along. Of course, given how inhumanly engorged you are, even just slowly moving your arms already causes your chest and traps to begin expanding of their own accord. Your chest and traps burgeon outwards as they fight for space with their neighboring muscles, your neck forming a ring around your head from the top-down due to its girth. Veins shoot outwards, reaching your face, some thick as a large battery.

Kris didn’t even care anymore, openly pleasuring herself in front of you, completely and utterly drunk on muscle lust. Once you finally manage to get your arms all the way down, you smile with gritted teeth as you transform into a human meatball of muscle. Your fists aren’t even able to reach each other due to the size of your chest, clashing with your arms. And even if that wasn’t the case, your biceps would be doing the exact same thing. Your shoulders were the size of volleyballs which, rippling unbelievably! Due to your sheer mass, you realize you have some sort of unprecedent control over every muscle. In your continued teasing of Kris, you make your delts shift like waves whilst your face registers no effort whatsoever.

Just as Kris fights her lust enough to get closer to the goddess before her, you aren’t done. You stop the crab flex and stand up, letting your arms rest at an angle to your sides. You let your pecs bounce in a sublime dance of muscle control, first individually, and then forming waves together… and then forming waves individually. Again, not an ounce of effort showing anywhere on your confident face, no harder than waggling a finger. You begin twisting, your steps making the apartment rumble as you clasp your hands together in front of your obscenely bulging abs. And with one swift motion, you perform a mind-boggling side-chest pose. Your chest shoots up like a rocket, hitting your chin, nowhere else to go. Your arms explode like volcanoes, and just as rugged.

All of this was too much for Kris. The second your chest shot up, she climaxes with a deafening scream that lasts a couple of seconds, not even touching your muscles to please herself into an earth-shattering orgasm.

<<if $shyConfident < 1>> You blush furiously as you realize what had just happened, avoiding Kris’s gaze as you rub the back of your head.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ummm, w-well I’m glad you e-enjoyed yourself!"<</Dialogue>>

Kris smirks, licking her lips contently as she looks up at you, no attempt to cover what happened down there. ‘Shame’ is clearly not in her vocabulary
<<Dialogue "KrisCasualObsessed" "Kris">>"Oh, I’d say I more than enjoyed myself, <<print $playerFirstName>>."<</Dialogue>>


Too flustered by the outcome, you quickly rush to grab all your clothes and head to a bathroom to get changed, leaving footprints on the floor and inevitably shattering the doorframe. Kris, meanwhile, simply sits down on the couch and basks in the afterglow of the whole experience. <<else>> You chuckle and reach down, lifting Kris up with one hand and frenching her with utter abandon, in a pure display of your power. You detach from her, looking her in the eye, unfazed by what just happened down there.


<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hehe, brace yourself, because I’m not even winded."<</Dialogue>>

You reach down to feel a certain slickness between your legs, the sensation of all this mighty flexing having aroused you beyond belief. You bring your finger back up, seductively licking your juices. <</if>>
<</if>>

<<if $firstTimeKrisSex != true>>And thus concludes your first date with Kris. It feels weird, meeting her like this on the first date. But with her personality, was there really any other option? You think about it for some time during your shower afterwards, not sure what to make of it. You walk home, and before you even register it, you have already crossed the door. Not that you had many expectations, but you certainly didn’t envision whatever it was that happened in her apartment.

Send me a message when you actually get double-digits followers!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>And with that, you put your index finger on your nose and stick out your tongue while you wink, making sure to give your biceps a nice flex for extra effect. The pair blushes as you skip and hop around them, getting back on your way.<br><br>As you gain distance, you overhear one of them confessing to the other that you are actually kinda cute. You can’t help but smile.<</if>>`

You send a message to the super, asking for him to fix it, and to not just buy another cheap plastic faucet. He responds quickly… and points out that this is an old building, and all the faucets are made of brass.<br><br>You inspect the broken faucet… it is indeed brass. Holy shit, you knew you were getting strong… but… just how strong? Are we really getting dangerously close to superhuman here? You were frustrated, sure, but you weren’t actively trying to break it… what could you have done if you were purposefully trying?!?<br><br>You feel a tingle in your stomach, a mix of thrill and fear. It’s like having this nuclear power plant inside of you - if properly used, it gives you great power. But it also hides a nasty side, a potential for unmitigated disaster.

You grab a broom and start doing a little cleaning. Finding yourself lost in your thoughts, you ponder about being more careful around your furniture - it would be hard to afford constant repairs. But as the sweeping continues, you end up breaking the broom handle clean in the middle.<br><br>You look at the thick wooden handle. Before moving here, you remember chasing a rat at your old house, hitting that very same broom with all your might against the floor, repeatedly. But now, just doing some casual sweeping, you accidentally cleaved it in two parts. Just how strong are you getting?<br><br>There’s a mix of excitement and fear - on one hand, you feel like there’s this ever-expanding potential, waiting to be unleashed from within. You want so very badly to see how strong you could possibly get…<br><br>But… on the other hand… you also realize you can break things, or worse, hurt people. This shadow stands over you, ever present. And as these two facets of your conscience fight, part of you knows that there’s little chance you’ll just stop growing.”<<else>>Well, the crack on the wood isn’t too bad - you think you might just be able to splint it. So you grab a piece of wood, your hammer and some nails, and quickly get to work reinforcing the structure.<br><br>Carpentry, however, was never your specialty. You set the lumber in place, prepare the nail and start hitting… you hammer away, but it doesn’t take long until you’ve broke BOTH pieces of wood.<br><br>Well, I guess I just need to get better wood, right? Frustrated, you just forcefully put the hammer back in its fixed bracket shelf… which breaks right under it. Oops.<br><br>As you inspect the damage, you realize these were metal shelves. And you just cleaved the screws themselves from concrete. And these were some THICK screws. Sure, the shelf itself acted as a lever but… you are getting STRONG. Much stronger than you realized.<br><br>You give your flexed biceps a squeeze. Damn, they feel solid. It’s not just the thickness of the muscle - the sloped contour sure feels nice… but… they are, I don’t know, dense? It’s strangely arousing, realizing that you have this thing inside you growing, becoming better… a vast potential, just waiting to be tapped. It drives you to work harder and harder to figure it out.<br><br>You sit down cross-legged by the flipped couch. You find yourself unable to stop fantasizing about getting stronger and stronger. Why have you gone in this rabbit hole, you wonder, as you easily turn the couch back to its original position.<</if>>'

I never knew guys could be into strong girls…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You place your arm across your chest and give a small, humble flex, making your gigantic pythons flare with immense mass - round rock-hard globes merge from your capped shoulder into your biceps, with veins prominently showcased in what would seem like an impossible showcase of muscles and strength. Four eyes are immediately drawn to your demonstration, and one of the guys makes a weird, throaty noise as he tries to unsuccessfully breath with a constricted airway from the shock.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know, I really got into working out once I saw all the praise you had for muscle girls - I feel like I kinda owe it to you. Your passion was a great incentive, and really got me going!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The comment seems to break their minds even more. One of them manages to get a few words out.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait… that wasn’t that long ago… how long have you been… working out?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You make some quick mental calculation and tell them how many weeks since you started. Their eyes somehow find a way to open even wider. One of them looks around, looking for a hidden camera or some other explanation that might help make sense of this insanity.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >=60>>You aren’t sure what they expected to find behind them, but a bodybuilder-sized young woman was NOT it, clearly, as they let out a nervous laughter.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"HOLY SHIT, YOU ARE JACKED!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>He quickly covers his mouth, realizing he said that out loud. You giggle, and raise your arm in a shy and cute little flex as you smile.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I guess I got pretty strong! I was actually motivated by a conversation you guys had some days ago - really got me into the whole lifting thing!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The other guy raises his hand towards your biceps, but stops in his tracks, still mesmerized.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you wanna cop a feel? I guess you can’t do that on TekTok… go ahead!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The guy looks at your eyes, then your arm, then back to your face. He seems confused and pretty intimidated, so you nod to reinforce that it’s okay. His hand finishes its intended course, landing over your big and hard round biceps. His neck shifts forward and his jaw drops and he gives your granite-like biceps a tight squeeze, finding no give whatsoever - unable to even cover the top half of your arm with his fingers.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Dang! I never thought muscle would be this firm!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I really gotta thank you guys - I might still be a stick girl if you guys hadn’t lit this fire on me. So… thanks!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give them a cute wink. One of them pinches his arm, because he’s pretty sure he must be dreaming.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >=40>>They probably expected anything but to find another girl just as jacked as the one doing the chin-ups on their screen - which is made immediately clear by their expression of shock.<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Whoa! Babe alert!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The pair just scan you, top to bottom, realizing you look just like the fitness-competitor level women they’ve been ogling online all along - except right there in front of them… actually TALKING TO THEM! The surprise seems to have gotten them somewhat discombobulated.<br><br>You tilt your head, somewhat confused at their reaction. They seem to continue to admire your hard work, their eyes continuously following your meaty legs, your toned arms, your capped shoulders and your protruding abs. You’d think that for two guys who appreciate fit women, they wouldn’t find it so amazing…?<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Whoa! Do you have a TekTok account?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<if $furniture.includes("web cam")>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, but I do some streaming every now and then… I suppose I have some fans of my physique there…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You find yourself giving them a brief flex of your biceps almost instinctively, and they both wolf-whistle simultaneously. You giggle, not quite used to real-life compliments like this - it’s usually just the chat going a bit wild.<br><br><<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, but I’ve been thinking about getting a webcam and doing some streaming… maybe something with a fitness theme going? I don’t know…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Both of them shout simultaneously: “YES, PLEASE DO!” It makes you giggle.<</if>>They promise to keep an eye out for you online, and you decide you should thank them:<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You know, I started my fitness journey because I overheard the passion with you two were talking about muscular girls some days ago. So… thank you two, for setting me on this path!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They both look at each other, incredulously, as they bow and thank you back for your effort. That was surprisingly cute!<br><br><<else>>The two were not expecting to be approached by a girl during their… ahem… private discussion… so they are momentarily stunned, before fully appreciating that you are actually quite fit. Maybe not as big as some of the girls they stalk online - but it is clear to them that you work out.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Oh, hey! Not looking to shabby yourself, girl! Bet you work out too, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you can tell…?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You shrug in a cute girly way, then playfully flex your biceps. Neither of them expect the nice little bump that jumps out from your upper arm to be so salient.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"DANG!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Actually, I have you two to blame for that… I overheard you talking some days ago… and I guess I got bit by the fitness bug! It’s actually pretty cool, I keep surprising myself at how strong I’m getting!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give your quads a slap, making a loud clapping noise as your hand meets the firm resistance of your thighs. They shudder a bit, clearly aroused by your little display there.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Uh, you… you certainly look it!"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I know, right? And this is just from a few days - can you imagine how buff I’m gonna get by the end of the summer?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You hear them audibly gulping as they nod in awe.<br><br> <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Really, this is like, super-exciting… and I really do think I’m stronger than I look, even! I bet I could squat one of you right now, if I wanted!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>One of them chokes at that comment, and you laugh. The other asks if you really are serious about that.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, you don’t look THAT heavy! Jump up!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You turn around, giving the dude a piggyback. You estimate him to be like 130 pounds… so you proceed to pull some nice squats, and you can feel his heart beating faster against your chest… you could easily get used to that. You put the guy down, and he’s speechless.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Fuck! I totally should have filmed that!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You laugh at the comment, but both of them look dead serious about it.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, give me some time! Maybe next time I stumble on you I might be able to bench press you - or maybe squat both of you! I’ll make that my next goal!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You complete that with a wink, and you could swear they might’ve just climaxed from that comment alone.<br><br><</if>>Well, as it turns out, they really did motivate you… and just the thought of more people sharing this passion only makes the ember inside you burn brighter. You wonder how buff you’ll get in the future, and remind yourself that this is still just the beginning of your journey!<<link "Continue" $currentScene>><</link>><</replace>><</link>><<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 1 "How about just showing off a bit?">><<replace "#choice">>You approach them from behind and clear your throat. They turn, not quite ready for what is expecting them.<br><br><<if $muscle >= 80>>They start by your feet, and start tracking their heads up. Their jaws drop at your calves; They gasp at your thighs; Hyperventilation begins at your abs; There is slight shaking as they take in your arms and pecs… and finally freeze completely when they see your face.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"So I heard the two of you appreciate a strong girl?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You grab both by their belts, and lift each with one arm off the ground with relative ease.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Do I qualify? Or should I go back to the gym?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They wobble and shake, and you put them down before someone gets hurt. They are still shaking, partly due to the scare of being easily hoisted from the ground, part from just trying to wrap their brains around your enormous muscularity.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Can I interest you… in a little show? I feel I owe you one…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You go in a most muscular pose, and their eyes almost pop out of their respective skulls. You do a double-biceps for good measure, and encourage them to cop a feel.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, you should check how hard these arms are - they could use a little appreciation!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Each one of them goes for a different arm, and both are in equal disbelief in their incapacity to even envelope a fraction of your upper arm in their hands. They squeeze with all their might, but you just force your flex that tiny bit more and they almost flip out at the sheer durability of your flesh - they can’t even make any dent.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I mean, you already figured out I’m kinda strong… but I’m pretty sturdy too… here… punch me!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You raise your <<print $outfit.top()?.name || $outfit.overwear()?.name>>, revealing your fully flexed cobblestone abs. One of them almost chokes.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on, give it your best shot! I really wanna see if my training is paying off!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>They look at each other, trying to figure out how to proceed. The one who is more fit takes a deep breath and looks you in the eyes for confirmation. You nod, and he gives a very solid punch, which makes a muffled noise. You barely feel it, really… but… oh, poor guy… it looks like he might have hurt his hand a bit.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, I’m sorry… I must have gotten a bit carried away… I was just excited to share… because I started getting serious on my workouts after I heard you two talking about how much you dig muscular girls."<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"Wait, but that wasn’t really that long ago… you just started then?!?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, and I’m planning to keep going, though it’s getting easier and I’m getting more practice, so I expect my gains could actually start coming in faster… I wonder how strong I’ll be by the end of the summer!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The two fall to their knees, jaws agape. You might just have exploded their brains a bit. They both crawl to your feet and repeat they are not worthy. You laugh, and pull them up by their collars.<br><br><<elseif $muscle >= 60>>They find themselves in the presence of a veritable female bodybuilder, which is probably more than they were used to online - let alone in person. You let a sly smile out, and just give them a double-biceps pose with little fanfare. They watch as the peaks of your arms just keep going up… and up… and up… until you got a veritable mountain of muscle for show.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Is it true that you two appreciate a strong girl?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You proceed into a most muscular pose, then reveal your legs with a flex of your thighs and calves.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’ve been working hard on my physique since I heard you two talking about how hot you thought muscular women are… and I can’t deny - the results seem to confirm that, wouldn’t you say?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You might have blown their minds a bit too much, they seem momentarily unable to respond. You decide a quick peek of your abs may be in order, and you reveal your midriff. It jolts the two awake almost immediately.<br><br><<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random guy">>"HOLY SHIT, YOU’RE HOT!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You giggle at his abrupt comment, which you assume left his lips before his brain realized he should use his internal voice.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I suppose this muscle does look nice on me.

"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You give them a nice double-biceps flex, pointing your fingers to one side then the other, making your muscles twitch and roll on your arms - like you had a weasel running inside them. One of the guys coughs, and gets red in the face from lack of oxygen as he tries to catch his breath again.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You like these ?

	Well, you're running. You do have the advantage of being very light, even for your frame. But that also means there isn’t much muscle either. Thin legs and little core strength do you no favors.
<<elseif $bodyType is "average">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.1>>
	Running isn't MUCH of an issue for you, at least with your build. You're squarely average, so that means you pretty much got this, right? One leg in front of the other, rinse, repeat.

	Now this is something your athletic body is made for: quick, lithe muscles give you incredible speed, and since your bodyweight is still comparatively low, you got quite the spring to your step. With this build, you're sure you'll get an amazing workout from this!

With your pecs bouncing and thighs rubbing against each other, a well-oiled running machine you aren’t. But the balance between your power and weight is enough that you can get a good workout out of it. It just takes some extra effort, that’s all!
<<elseif $bodyType is "hulk">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	Yeah, when you run past, people notice. The explosive strength in your legs means you have little trouble building momentum and picking up a good speed, but the sheer mass of you does mean that the ground shakes at your passing and your momentum requires quite a bit of effort to come to a full stop. Windows rattle and floors shake as you run past, even when you try to be careful. But given your sheer mass, that is just the unavoidable reality!
<<elseif $bodyType is "strong">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	You're strong, nobody will doubt. But being able to run for a long time is a different matter; sure, you have got the power in your legs, but there is also a whole lot of mass to support and accelerate. It takes some time for you to get into the groove of it, but once your massive gather that momentum, you can keep a surprisingly steady pace!
<<elseif $bodyType is "heroic">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.1>>
	Your build has been referred to as 'heroic'. So it is no surprise that you run like a superhero too. You can build up amazing speed, and keep it going for a long time while your tree-trunk legs make you look like an Olympian goddess with purpose and grace! The Dash, step aside! <<print $playerFirstName>> is here!
<<elseif $bodyType is "gigantic">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.2>>
	Something as big as you shouldn't be running. Muscles so huge have no business being this quick, this powerful in their stride. Yet as you jog past, the ground shakes, surprising everyone that dares to look. Your body might be massive, but once it has gathered enough momentum, your gigantic leg muscles bulge and provide the full power they got in them. Plenty to get you going, and more than enough to pick up a respectable speed!
<<elseif $bodyType is "obese">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.5>>
	Why did you think running was a good idea? In no way or shape is your body made for it; thick layers of flab hide whatever muscles you have, and each step sends shockwaves through your body. But maybe that’s a good reason to do it anyway; to prove to yourself that you can do it, and to show that despite its sheer mass, your body has some hidden power!
<<elseif $bodyType is "thick">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>
	Yeah, you're not made for running. Within minutes, you're sweating and panting, trying to get your body to keep up. It's pure willpower that drives you along. Your steps are heavy, your body flabby, and damn it all, you're doing your best!
<<elseif $bodyType is "heavy">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>
	Sure, you're a bit heavier than others. And no one would accuse you of having a stereotypical runner body, but that doesn't mean you can't try, right? Once you start, you're doing decently, but you tire way quicker than someone lighter. Well, this is your body, and it’s time to make the most of it!
<<elseif $bodyType is "strongman">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	Your body isn't one where people normally look at you and say 'now THAT’S a jogger'. You got immensely thick arms and legs with a noticeable amount of flab over your muscles. Yet, beneath, lies immense strength. You start slow and quickly begin picking up speed. And with your endurance, you can easily maintain a very respectable pace.
<<elseif $bodyType is "fat">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	Why are you even jogging? Nothing about your body is really meant to run: you have got a flabby stomach, and little leg muscles to get that pace up. But perhaps that’s all the more reason to do it – not that you need one. After all, your body dictates the ceiling here, but YOU decide how much effort you put in.
<<elseif $bodyType is "monstrous">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	Your mass is immense. As you start running, at first you waddle forward, thighs rubbing against each other. Yet you just keep picking up speed, those leg muscles increasing your momentum like thick pistons. From a slow waddle you progress into a decent jog, and finally an unstoppable run. The sheer momentum is only controlled by your powerful sinew, all of it pumping and swelling as you start genuinely running. Whether you are leaving a trail of cracked pavement or just causing mini earthquakes is not your concern right now.
<<elseif $bodyType is "sumowrestler">>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>
	Running. You might have huge muscles under all that flab, but running isn't something people imagine when they see you. Your gigantic body picks up inertia and momentum as your speed increases, which happens slowly. But as you start running, your pace just keeps picking up, until you are eventually in an honest-to-God run. Your feet slam against the pavement, and like a train picking up speed, you know that anything that crosses your path has two choices: move, or be moved.

<<if _workoutSkill == 0>>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.1>>
	Hmmm. Maybe you would think that 'go out for a run' is something simple. But you notice that your pace isn't very steady. You stop and go erratically, pace constantly fluctuating as you stop to catch your breath all the time. It might be lack of experience, but, hey, that's why you're here, right? To improve yourself! 
<<elseif _workoutSkill == 1>>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.2>>
	Your recent research into fitness and how your body works does help with keeping a steady pace. While you're far from an expert, you know well enough stretch beforehand, and to keep and eye on your heartrate.
<<elseif _workoutSkill == 2>>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>
	Yeah, you know how to run. You're experienced with all the smaller details and your starting stretches catch people’s eyes. From warming up to keeping pace... it just comes easily! And it pays off, as your workout is way more effective.
<<elseif _workoutSkill == 3>>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>
	With your knowledge of working out and biomechanics, it’s no surprise you run with such conviction. Lots of people assume that jogging is just 'going for a run', but you could spend hours talking about how to maximize it! From warms ups to cooldowns, pacing and BPMs... you won’t overlook any small details, and you got it all down to a T.
<<elseif _workoutSkill == 4>>
	<<set _fatLoss += 0.5>>
	Regardless of your body type, you make the most of it. With your knowledge of fitness and body mechanics, you could easily coach others, and your own workouts are nothing short of displays of excellence. Pacing, blood oxygen levels, BPM... you juggle it all constantly without batting an eye, making it all easier for you to keep a steady pace and jog like a true pro.

Eagerly, you plug the USB stick into your old PC, dropping the box with the stuff you got from... Toshi, was it? It seems the old occupant of this room had plenty of stuff, and who knows what this little treasure trove holds! Your PC is frustratingly slow, making you tap impatiently. Normally when you plug in a hard drive or something, you get the results instantly, but not this time. A new window does pop up eventually, revealing a handful of files. Looking over the names... JACKPOT! On the screen, you see the following:
<br><br>

• Selfie.png
<br>
• Experiment_log_01.txt
<br>
• Selfie_2.png
<br>
• Experiment_log_02.txt
<br>
• Inventory.txt
<br>
• Doctors note.txt
<br>
• Chemistry notes.docx
<br><br>

You decide to go for the first exciting one; Experiment_log_01.txt. With a pounding heart you double-click on it to open it, and... what?!? A small prompt the likes of which you’ve never seen before, requesting a password. Password?!? What kind of password? Who the fuck password-protects files on an unprotected USB key? Out of frustration, your hand slams against the desk, <<if $muscle > 60>>cracking the wood. You're lucky the table is still able to support your PC but you should avoid such displays of rage.<<elseif $muscle > 40>> which shakes as your fist hits it, the wood groaning menacingly. Right, newfound strength... you should keep that in mind...<<else>> barely missing your keyboard.<</if>>

<br><br>

Well, here you are. Assuming he picked secure passwords, then it should be next to impossible to just guess them. But come on, you're no quitter. Those file names... those do NOT look like the kind of names a safety-minded individual would use. So, 7 files... 7 passwords. Time to do some research.

Windows rattle and floors shake as you run past, even when you try to be careful. But given your sheer mass, that is just the unavoidable reality!<<elseif $bodyType is "strong">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>> You're strong, nobody will doubt. But being able to run for a long time is a different matter; sure, you have got the power in your legs, but there is also a whole lot of mass to support and accelerate. It takes some time for you to get into the groove of it, but once your massive gather that momentum, you can keep a surprisingly steady pace!<<elseif $bodyType is "heroic">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.1>> Your build has been referred to as 'heroic'. So it is no surprise that you run like a superhero too. You can build up amazing speed, and keep it going for a long time while your tree-trunk legs make you look like an Olympian goddess with purpose and grace! The Dash, step aside! <<print $playerFirstName>> is here!<<elseif $bodyType is "gigantic">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.2>>Something as big as you shouldn't be running. Muscles so huge have no business being this quick, this powerful in their stride. Yet as you jog past, the ground shakes, surprising everyone that dares to look. Your body might be massive, but once it has gathered enough momentum, your gigantic leg muscles bulge and provide the full power they have got in them. Plenty to get you going, and more than enough to pick up a respectable speed!<<elseif $bodyType is "obese">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.5>>Why did you think running was a good idea? In no way or shape is your body made for it; thick layers of flab hide whatever muscles you have, and each step sends shockwaves through your body. But maybe that’s a good reason to do it anyway; to prove to yourself that you can do it, and to show that despite its sheer mass, your body has some hidden power!<<elseif $bodyType is "thick">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>Yeah, you're not made for running. Within minutes, you're sweating and panting, trying to get your body to keep up. It's pure willpower that drives you along. Your steps are heavy, your body flabby, and damn it all, you're doing your best!<<elseif $bodyType is "heavy">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>Sure, you're a bit heavier than others. And no one would accuse you of having a stereotypical runner body, but that doesn't mean you can't try, right? Once you start, you're doing decently, but you tire way quicker than someone lighter. Well, this is your body, and it's time to make the most of it!<<elseif $bodyType is "strongman">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>Your body isn't one where people normally look at you and say 'now THAT’S a jogger'. You got immensely thick arms and legs with a noticeable amount of flab over your muscles. Yet, beneath, lies immense strength. You start slow and quickly begin picking up speed. And with your endurance, you can easily maintain a very respectable pace.<<elseif $bodyType is "fat">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>Why are you even jogging? Nothing about your body is really meant to run: you have got a flabby stomach, and little leg muscles to get that pace up. But perhaps that's all the more reason to do it – not that you need one. After all, your body dictates the ceiling here, but YOU decide how much effort you put in.<<elseif $bodyType is "monstrous">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.3>>Your mass is immense. As you start running, at first you waddle forward, thighs rubbing against each other. Yet you just keep picking up speed, those leg muscles increasing your momentum like thick pistons. From a slow waddle you progress into a decent jog, and finally an unstoppable run. The sheer momentum is only controlled by your powerful sinew, all of it pumping and swelling as you start genuinely running. Whether you are leaving a trail of cracked pavement or just causing mini earthquakes is not your concern right now.<<elseif $bodyType is "sumowrestler">>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.4>>Running. You might have huge muscles under all that flab, but running isn't something people imagine when they see you. Your gigantic body picks up inertia and momentum as your speed increases, which happens slowly. But as you start running, your pace just keeps picking up, until you are eventually in an honest-to-God run.

To improve yourself! <<elseif _workoutSkill == 1>>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.2>>Your recent research into fitness and how your body works does help with keeping a steady pace.

Lots of people assume that jogging is just 'going for a run', but you could spend hours talking about how to maximize it! From warms ups to cooldowns, pacing and BPMs... you won't overlook any small details, and you got it all down to a T.<<elseif _workoutSkill == 4>>	<<set _fatLoss += 0.5>>Regardless of your body type, you make the most of it. With your knowledge of fitness and body mechanics, you could easily coach others, and your own workouts are nothing short of displays of excellence.

You can only assume there must be someone new moving into the building, though it does strike you as odd that someone would be moving in at this point.

The more elaborate ones can be pretty delicate, so I wanted to take extra care in transporting them.

I'll be the first to tell you it's not a cheap hobby, but it's not as if I went out and bought this all last night!

Before you even know it, you're carrying the last load from the front door up to Johan's apartment.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Man. I know I commented earlier on there being a lot of these, but are you sure you have room for all of this at your place?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"Oh, it'll be fine. Like I said, it'll take up a lot less space once they're all out of the boxes, and with a little work I should be able to find a more permanent solution..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan's voice trails off and you see a furious blush rising to his face. He sputters a bit and starts looking this and that way. He's gone straight from being his normal, happy, talkative self to a flustered ball of anxiety.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Johan? Johan, what's the matter?"<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"The matter? Well, nothing's the matter per se, it's just that, well, I just, you see, I happened to notice, well, it's just something that, I thought, maybe, I should probably bring to your attention, but perhaps I shouldn't, but maybe you'd...<br>*gulp*<br>It... you should look at your chest.<</Dialogue>><br><br>Puzzled, you look down and quickly realize why he got so worked up. Two quickly growing dark splotches soaking through your <<print $outfit.top().name>>. Oh no. That growing pressure in your breasts passed unnoticed among all that box-lugging effort. You're leaking milk right through your <<print $outfit.top().name>><br><br><<if $Shy >= 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, God. Oh, no. I'm sorry, I-"<</Dialogue>><br><br>You hastily move to cover yourself, dropping the boxes you were carrying in the process. You stand there, quickly moving back and forth between collecting the dropped boxes and preserving your own modesty. All the while, you can feel the dampness spreading through your top and warm milk trickling between your fingers, your anxiety only growing as the flow of milk increases.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I, I... I'm sorry, Johan, I need to go!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>Without allowing Johan a chance to respond, you sprint off to the stairs towards your own room, covering your chest as you run, droplets of milk flinging left and right as you go. You run inside, slam the door behind yourself, and quickly toss your <<print $outfit.top().name>> aside. You run to the kitchen sink and squeeze your dripping breasts, desperate to relieve the pressure and stop the embarrassing leaking. You sigh in equal parts relief and embarrassment. Being caught leaking by your only friend in the building! You're absolutely mortified. The sound of twin jets of milk hitting your sink provides an almost meditative background noise as you contemplate your embarrassment. You don't even know how you're going to show your face to Johan next time.<<elseif $carefree >= 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, shoot. I had a bad feeling about that. Well, no worries. It's just the two of us here and we're nearly finished anyway. Let me get this last load up to your place before I fix this.<</Dialogue>><br><br>You shift the boxes so that they're no longer touching your chest, to keep your milk from soaking into them. Johan, meanwhile, has locked eyes with you in an adamant attempt to avoid appearing as though he's looking at your leaking breasts.<br><br><<Dialogue "Johan" "Johan">>"$playerFirstName, I... Honestly, you should, probably, you know, go and take care of that, before, you know...<</Dialogue>><br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don't sweat it. We'll move quick, and if someone does come along... eh, don't worry about it. I didn't think to take care of it, so it's my problem, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>The two of you continue through the stairs and hallways, your breasts soaking through your <<print $outfit.top().name>> and leaving a trail of milk droplets on the floor for all to see. Johan's blush has yet to leave his face, and he continues to look straight ahead as he walks. Before long you reach his apartment and you drop off the boxes you were carrying. Despite your talk, you are a bit relieved you didn't run into anyone else on the way.<br><br><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"And job done! I better go take care of this. Talk to you later, Johan!<</Dialogue>><br><br>Johan mumbles something in response, quickly ducking back into his apartment and waving a goodbye, still attempting to avoid any awkward eye movements. You find your way back downstairs quickly. You make an inane attempt at covering your chest as you walk, but it's clear at this point that you aren't going to be able to stop the milk from spilling easily. By the time you reach your apartment, the flow has progressed to several streams spraying weakly through your <<print $outfit.top().name>>. As soon as the door shuts, you remove the soaked top and begin to empty your still strained breasts into your kitchen sink. You sigh with relief, and to your slight shame, a bit of pleasure, as you squeeze heavy streams of milk out of your breasts. It takes several minutes with you bent forward over the sink to get your heavy breasts to stop leaking on their own. During the quiet time, you realize how glad you are that only Johan saw you like this. Had it been a stranger, it would have been terribly embarrassing, but with Johan... Well, maybe he was a bit embarrassed. But you can make it up to him, right?<</if>>`

She is at the end of the counter, shaking a cup with your name written on it. And the grin is still there. You walk over, and grab the cup, but it takes a small tug for her to let go. You walk out, taking a sip… wait a minute. You open the paper container, to find it’s just steamed milk.<br><br>

And frankly, it does sound somewhat tempting: if you are intent on pursuing fitness as an interest, this is definitely a no-brainer - you are bound to learn more about nutrition and fitness at the job, and take home some supplements on top of that? Sure, it’s bound to be a lot of work, given Eddy’s... uh... lax organizational skills?

The odd red carpet, the same box... you know for sure it's the guy who inhabited this apartment before you. And given the lab coat and his pose, you bet he's the one responsible for all these strange drinks. You try and see if you can get more from the file, but for now, you can't think of anything. All the metadata has been corrupted, and you only got the filename and the image...

<<if $usbPassword3Unlocked == true>>
Compared to the other selfie, he's a LOT smaller! If you only knew how much time elapsed between these two selfies, but taking into consideration he's only been in this room for a year, that he looks pretty much the same if you ignore his size, at most we are talking a few months in-between. You wonder... <<if $muscle > 80>>are you growing even faster than him, giving how huge you already are?<<else>>is this how big you will become too? Do you even want that?

'toshi experiment log - January 1st, 2020'

It was written half a year before you moved here.

<<Dialogue "toshiUnknown" "Toshi">>
Okaaaaay, so! I dunno how, but so far it has been a resounding success! I can't precisely explain HOW my stuff works, but I do know that my stuff works. Once the initial dose of the gene-unlocker has been digested, anyone can benefit from the different variants of the distillation. What I didn't expect was to also make them taste like something; without the gene-unlocker, all of the distillations just taste like water. But, it doesn't matter!

I've drank the Gene-unlocker about a week ago now, and I gotta say, I feel fine! Okay, okay, maybe drinking your own untested experiments is a BIT of a gamble, but come on! The results were so promising! And so far, it's just AMAZING. If my readings are correct, I gained nearly <<if $measuringSystem == "imperial">>10lbs<<else>>5kg<</if>> of lean muscle mass, while my height increased by <<if $measuringSystem == "imperial">>1"<<else>>2cm<</if>>. There was noticeable soreness and muscle fatigue, but those are to be expected and VERY mild compared to normal side effects! I do eat a ton though, and man, the microwave burgers are getting expensive.... same with all the ingredients for the distillations. It's a good thing I sold that box of old junk, but now I can't find some of the previous distillations I made... I hope I didn't sell those...
<</Dialogue>>

There is a lot to unpack here. The thing you drank from the fridge must be one of the 'Gene-unlockers' that allows you to benefit from the other potions. That probably also explains why they don't do anything to anyone else. You had hoped for more information, but combined with the other logs, you're sure you will piece it all together.

How long has it been between these 2 selfies?! Years? Months? Weeks...? It's almost scary how big he has gotten.<<else>>You don't know who this is, or why you haven't heard of someone this... size. You're sure that someone THIS huge would be like an urban legend on the Internet. Who is he?<</if>><<if $muscle > 80>> Something else that stands out to you is how you're already bigger than him. Your own muscles would bulge just as much, your own pecs explode from your clothing. You pause for a second as you look at it, not sure how this makes you feel. <<else>> and looking at the sheer size on him, you wonder how he felt about it. This could be you at some point.<<if $shyConfident > 0>>But that physique does look amazing, and if you looked like that... would that be so bad?<<else>> You're no sure you even want to look like that.

The text file loads very slowly. It's surprising it takes this long, but once it finally does, you are left with a textlog written April 1st, 2020. It's part of a bigger file called Toshi Experiment log. Well, let's see what you can learn. 

<<Dialogue "toshiUnknown" "Toshi">>
Few months into the experiment, and okay, things have gotten a BIT extreme. With all different distillation I've noted a nearly 1200% increase in muscle mass, a 20% increase in stature, and a 10% increase in body hair... I think. To be honest, most of these are just guesses. What is clear is that I've advanced WELL beyond normal human limits. It seems however that in recent weeks the initial  gene-unlocker lost some of its potency. All the distillations lost some of their effects, and I think that my growth has slowed down, or perhaps I've even begun to shrink. This might be good, but I do enjoy this growth. Sure, I had to move to a different place not to attract too much attention, but being this big... is amazing.
<</Dialogue>>

There was a lot to digest in this one. Apparently the writer of this document grew a LOT from his experiments, just like you did. But he describes here how the growth may slow down, or even reverse, if you don't take another batch of that... gene-unlocker, was it? The gene-unlocker must be the drink you found in your fridge; if that one runs out... suddenly, you're very aware of the changes your body has undergone. So far, you've accepted and enjoyed them without questioning anything. A big part of that was believing them to be permanent, but now that you know you might lose them over time... 

Do you even want that?

You got the password, you got the file, let's see what this baby holds! It's another log file or something, just a small part of a bigger whole, but you think you can still get some good information from it.  It also seems a lot older, looking at the file information. At from a few years ago...

<<Dialogue "toshiUnknown" "Toshi">>
Okay, okay, so some of the gene-unlockers got misplaced. This is bad. I really gotta start being more careful with my distillations as I seem to have lost two. Why did I even take them outside?!? One of them I had to have lost yesterday. I already retraced all my steps, I think. I went back to the library, to the museum, the gym... even the community garden. I asked everyone I saw in those places, even the cute Italian girl. She was so shy I had to dig the answers out of her.

The problem was too that this was a more refined version; it was a gene-unlocker with several distillations, all combined. It was meant to be diluted, and now a full bottle of that is out there, somewhere! Unless someone has drunk it already. Argh, I haven’t even had a chance to test this myself, and now it might hurt someone!
<</Dialogue>>

<<if $elenaOpinion >= 10>>Wait. Cute, shy, Italian girl... oh God... Elena?!<<else>>Well, that doesn't help much...<</if>>

:: usbFile6 {"position":"1900,1300","size":"100,100"}
This file opens quickly and you're presented with a handwritten note. The scanned paper comes from a doctor’s office, describing a full body review of someone named Toshi. By now, you got a good idea of who this might be.

<br>'Medical examination, May 4th, patient; Toshi [DATA CORRUPTED].</b>

Though Toshi shows a musculature and height increase that medical science cannot explain, his health doesn't seem to have been impacted at all. His cardiovascular system seems to have adapted incredibly well to the physiological expansion, and even the stress on joints caused by the huge increase in weight seems to be compensated by unexplained reinforced durability. It's downright remarkable how, despite the logical conclusion that Toshi SHOULD have all kind of side effects from excessive growth, there are none our team can discern. His vitals are fine, and although his blood panel is all over the place, somehow his metabolic functions appear to be just fine. His diet, though extreme, also corresponds to someone of his new size.

As his situation is unprecedented, and well beyond the experience of a general practitioner. Having a man show up, nearly <<if $measurementSystem == 'metric'>>215 centimeters<<else>>7 feet<</if>> tall and more muscular than any bodybuilder on record isn't something we normally handle. Especially if that man used to be of average height and on the thin side. 

One more troubling thing, though, was Toshi's reaction to his changes. One would expect episodes of body dysmorphia, or any manifestation of stress. Yet the impression I got from him was more... what the youth these days would classify as 'stoked'. He was overly excited, and while I'm happy the changes did not cause him concern, his reaction to my suggestion of having his changes studied by a more experienced medical team did mark a change in his behavior. He immediately became evasive in his answers. He is known for being very scatterbrained. And though I've known him since he was a small boy, this new behavior does worry me.  His personality has changed dramatically, and though he does not seem to be aware of it, this raises questions about psychological implications.

From what I've observed, his growth was not spontaneous, and Toshi is aware of the trigger, somehow. Whatever it is, it also seems to have affected his personality. Though the changes so far could be perceived as positive, I'm worried about him. He's never been this secretive.

<b>END OF FILE</b>

So, Toshi had gone to a medical practitioner and had himself reviewed. This feels odd to you; this matches what has happened to your body so far, and reading that those odd drinks could even change your personality... it does make you wonder who YOU even are, or who you want to be. As you take some time to sit down and ponder all of this, you wonder why you are still consuming that shit. But on the other hand... you just read a written record that your health is fine. And who else in the world even has this opportunity? 

Well, one person. Toshi.

The file loads even slower than the others. In the time it takes to open, you could easily make a cup of tea, stare at the screen, and experience a refreshing bit of existential dread about the current situation you're in; hacking an USB stick so you can figure out what the fuck is going on with your body. When it finally loads though, it's just a.... spreadsheet? You study it for a moment; a list of names, along with their effects... wait a minute, these match the labels of the potions you found! Though it's all a bit more scientific than you are used to, you could now figure out what each drink would do to you!

:: Emma Date Two Intro {"position":"750,4375"}
With less than fifteen minutes until you clock out, you're trying to find ways to look busy. Given that, you jump slightly when you notice Emma striding towards your desk. Quickly, you reach for something to do so you don't have to face a stern glare or risk a lecture. Before you have a chance to pick up your task, you feel a hand gently resting on your shoulder. You turn to face the person, andssee Emma looking at you, an uncharacteristic softness on her face, along with the hint of a smile.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Excellent. I was just about to make my way there. I'll text you the address and we can meet there."<</Dialogue>>

You nod enthusiastically, and you wave to one another as Emma makes her way out of the office. As much as you'd like to just spring up and follow her... Well, now that you know she's paying attention you can't clock out early. You resign yourself to a few very slow minutes of waiting before you can acceptably leave.

Emma frowns an dpurses her lips, just slightly.

<<Dialogue "Emma" "Emma">>"Well, that's fair. I suppose it was short notice. Sorry to have bothered you, <<print $playerFirstName>>."<</Dialogue>>

With that, she marches off, looking as busy as she always does. You get the feeling that you missed an important hint here, reinforced by the fact she called you by your first name. You continue working, pondering it as you go home.

<<link "Go home" "Home">><</link>>


:: Emma Date Two Gym {"position":"750,4575"}
The gym itself isn't terribly far from work, thankfully. It's also a notably fancier than the one on your college campus. Everything sleek, clean, and modern. Holy crap, there's even a cafe right up front? And a spa?! You can't help but compare it in your mind to your normal spot, but that just makes you feel more out of place.

You're so busy taking in your surroundings that you don't notice a voice calling your name until it's practically shouting at you.

<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random">>"Ma'am? Ma'am!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh shoot, uh, yes? Sorry, what's up?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random">>"Uh... Can I see your member ID, please?"<</Dialogue>>

You look around and realize that you were about to walk right past the front desk.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"<<if $confident > 1>>Oh, that, yeah, I was just on my way to meet someone here. She should have everything under control.<<else>>Oh, uh... I'm very sorry. I was expecting to... I'll just go.<</if>>"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Not to worry, Rodney. She's with me."<</Dialogue>>

The sound of Emma's voice is clear, and both you and Rodney the front desk clerk turn to face her.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Nice to see you made it here without issue, <<print $playerFirstName>>. I've already signed you in as my guest, and Rodney should have everything you need ready to go."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "randomPerson" "Random">>"Oh, this is your guest! Yes ma'am, I've got everything here for you. Towel, guest pass, and a temporary key for a locker."<</Dialogue>>

You would have offered a polite thank you, but your eyes haven't moved from Emma, and you're fairly certain your brain has disconnected from your mouth. She had mentioned she was a bodybuilder, but you hadn't imagined this at all!

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"S-sorry. It's just... wow."<</Dialogue>>

<span id="choice2" style="display:none;">You follow Emma a short walk away to the women's lockers, and she leaves after saying she'll meet you at the base of the stairs. You find a quiet corner and prepare to change into your gym clothes. The image of Emma practically undressed doesn't seem to want to leave your head. You're not sure if it's simply shock at the incongruity of it all, or something deeper than that <<if $dick > 0>>though a certain, very active part of your anatomy is making its opinion known. It's creating an extra hurdle to put your <<print $outfit.bottom().name>> on<</if>>. You shake your head and tell yourself that you knew exactly what you had signed up for.

You eventually get changed into your gym clothes and find Emma waiting outside as expected. She sees you approach as she finishes a quick swig from a water bottle and smiles to you. A drop drips down one side of her mouth, cascading over that vascular, bull-like neck. 

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Shall we?"<</Dialogue>>

God, it's just as shocking as the first time around.

<span id="choice1"><<link "Compliment her on her body">><<replace "#choice1">><<set $emmaDateFriendly += 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Wow. I mean, I know it barely needs saying, but... you have done some amazing work."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I'm flattered."<</Dialogue>>

box.style.display = 'block';<</script>><</replace>><</link>></span>

<span id="choice2" style="display: none;">You follow Emma toward the rear of the gym. You pass by a lot of sights that you were used to seeing at the gym prior to all this. Older folks staying active, a lot of people your age mostly fast-walking on treadmills... But the section to the rear is much less crowded, and those that are there are clearly serious fitness types. Fitness model women in the squat cages, burly men noisily forcing huge weights into the air... This new side of Emma looks right at home here.

You see her give a cordial wave to a few of the individuals you pass, though without exchanging any words. Emma clearly is here with a singular purpose, and people know it. She guides you towards a rack of dumbbells, with an array of benches and chairs facing them as people let her pass. When Emma is in the zone, her attitude grants her more than enough confidence to make up for her average height.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I'm focusing primarily on my shoulders today. I hope that's not too much of a concern for you. If you have your own routine I'm sure we can both stick to our own exercises while staying close by."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $skills[0].level > 1>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No big deal. I can adapt around it. Let's hit those delts!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Wonderful. Let's start with some shoulder presses."<</Dialogue>><<else>><<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I'm totally fine doing whatever you do. To be honest, I don't have much of a routine."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Fair enough. We'll begin with shoulder presses, and I'll start. Hopefully a demonstration 	is of some benefit to you."<</Dialogue>><</if>>

Emma grabs a hefty pair of dumbbells from the rack, <<if $metric is true>>20 kg<<else>>45 lbs<</if>> printed in big block letters on each side of them. She takes a deep breath, seeming to steady herself as she does so, then quickly hoists the weights into the air, her arms bent to a right angle. You watch silently as she then powers the dumbbells up above her head, the muscle fibers in her shoulders and arms visibly tensing as she does so. Then she repeats, her form perfect and unwavering. She moves like a machine, and the sharp, hissing exhale she makes as her she reaches the peak of each lift does nothing to dispell that image. She pounds her way through her routine, movements always forceful and always steady, until she's done about a dozen lifts and she carefully allows her arms to fall to her side with a satisfied sigh.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Ahhh, good start. Would you like to take your set now?"<</Dialogue>>

<<if $skills[0].level >= 4>>You nod happily and walk to the dumbbell rack, finding the weights you're used to using. You practically know the numbers by heart, even though they've been increasing very quickly as of late. You take the same seat and begin your exercise in a manner much similar to Emma's. You know proper form perfectly well, of course, but now you felt obligated to put on a show as well. You take the movements as slow and steadily as you safely can, relishing the pleasant burning as it starts to radiate from your shoulders. You follow through with form as perfect as you can manage, attempting to match or best Emma in your own dozen reps. As you count out the last rep, your arms are on fire and you have to work just to not drop 	the weights on the floor. But you feel proud of your effort, and as you roll your shoulders, Emma steps up in front of you.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Wow, I'm impressed. And I don't say that lightly. You clearly know your stuff."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Thank you. I've been working hard at this. I'm just happy to see it's paying off."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I should say so. I may need to ask you for pointers after we're done here."<</Dialogue>>

Your evening continues on in much the same way, the two of you giving a performance as 	perfect as possible, and attempting to assist and teach each other along the way.

<<elseif $skills[0].level > 1>>You size up the weights on the rack and grab a pair that feels right. You take your seat, inhale deeply, and carefully lift the weights upward. You feel your arms and back respond immediately, burning with exertion as you first shove the weights upward. You quickly find yourself breathing heavily as you power through your set. You grit your teeth and force yourself through, not willing to give anything less than a perfect performance now that you have someone observing you. You barely manage to bring it to your last lift, and you nearly collapse against the chair from exertion. Emma gently puts a hand to your shoulder.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Well done. May I offer some advice, though?"<</Dialogue>>

Without waiting for a response, she brings her arms up as if she were doing the same exercise again, pantomiming her way through another set.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"You have sort of a bounce at the bottom of your lifts. You don't come steadily to a stop at the end. That's both cheating yourself and increasing your risk of injury. Try to come to a steady stop before your start the next eccentric movement."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh shoot. I hadn't even realized. Thanks, I'll try to keep an eye on that."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Constant improvement is the name of the game. Try to give it a shot in your next set here in a minute."<</Dialogue>>

Your evening continues in much the same way, with Emma spending equal time pushing through 	her own exacting workout and acting as a mentor for yours.

<<else>>You size up the long row of dumbbells, feeling quite intimidated by the whole affair. <<if $muscle > 80>>Going by instinct, you simply walk to one end and grab the heaviest pair that they have, hoping that you haven't already outgrown them.<<elseif $muscle < 20>>Going by instinct, you simply walk to one end and grab the smallest pair that they have, still worrying slightly that they will prove too much of a challenge.<<else>>You start at the size Emma had chosen, and work your way down the smaller options until you reach one that looks to be the right size, at least based on your gut feeling.<</if>> You take the weights in hand and do your best to imitate Emma's movements, putting your hands up besides your head and pushing the weights upwards. You only get three lifts in before you are interrupted.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Put the weights down immediately, please."<</Dialogue>>

Her voice is stern and forceful, but not shouting. You feel like you're back at work and she's caught you watching a meme compilation video. Without thinking you drop the weights to the floor and look at her, concerned. Her face looks like you've done something to personally offend her, though her eyes are wide with shock. This quickly shifts to her screwing her eyes shut and pinching her nose.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I should have known better. Honestly, I'm surprised you didn't tear a tendon like that."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, geez. I'm sorry, I really didn't know this was that serious-"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Here."<</Dialogue>>

She crouches behind you, putting her hands under your arms. She guides you upward, gently moving your arms through the sequence.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Slow and steady. Always control your movements. Never jerk the weight up and never allow it to just fall. Feeling better now?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Uh... Y-yes. Thank you."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Good. Now, how about you give it another try, slowly and carefully this time."<</Dialogue>>

Your evening continues in much the same way. Emma tackles her workout expertly, and you follow behind attempting to copy her as best as you can, with plenty of tutorial from her along the way.<</if>>

[[Ugh, I can't feel my arms|Emma Date Two Finale]]</span>

:: Emma Date Two Finale {"position":"750,4775"}
After what feels like hours, the two of you are finally resting. You take a comfortable seat and chug some water, while Emma stands nearby in front of a wall of mirrors. You watch along as she inspects her body, veins now standing in prominently above her taut muscles and the fibers all along her broad shoulders standing out like an anatomy chart. She turns and strike a side triceps pose which makes her shoulders flair out like cannonballs. The image still manages to take you by surprise. But despite what a great display Emma puts on, there's still a tinge of disappointment on her face.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What's the matter?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Mmm. It's nothing, really. Just noticing that my arms seem to be lagging behind the rest of my body. I worry I've been slacking."<</Dialogue>>

She stands up straight again and attempts a different pose, her bicep bunching up in the process.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Just based off what I saw tonight, I'd be surprised if you were slacking anywhere"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"It's flattering, I assure you. But I'm sure I just need to up my working weight a bit, or perhaps add on some more volume..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Emma, seriously. You look like you're getting ready to step onto a bodybuilding stage right now. Hell, you're doing the poses and everything."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Again, flattering. But I am nowhere close to a professional bodybuilder, and I don't pretend to be."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Plenty of people would disagree with you. I seriously don't know why you don't at least try since you're already basically there."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"As I've said before, I have my reasons."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But you've never told me what they are."<</Dialogue>>

Emma huffs and pushes her glasses into the bridge of her nose. She's silent for a moment, looking almost contemplative.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"It wouldn't be appropriate."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What do you mean?"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I mean, think of how you saw me when I first hired you. Very, very differnet from how you see me now, wouldn't you agree? This is not a flattering image to everybody. To do something as public as competing in a bodybuilding competition, or something far less than that even, would put a different image of myself into the heads of not just my colleagues, but nearly everyone I interact with. There's a reason I'm so choosy about who I share this interest with. This lifestyle is enjoyable, yes, but it also runs the risk of making me a laughingstock if I'm not careful with it."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I don't know if that's true... I mean, seeing you in your full glory was a surprise for sure, but... you're still you. The way you go about this whole thing is still very Emma. And I think people would be a lot more accepting than you give them credit for."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Maybe you're right. But maybe you're not. And it's not a risk I'm willing to accept. I can't put a career at risk over a hobby."<</Dialogue>>

There's an awkard moment of silence a tracksuit on over, once again obscuring her body from the outside world. Maybe she had a point. Now that you've seen what she looks like, you can't help but notice the broadness of her shoulders, the flair of her hips, the thickness of her arms, even as it's all hidden from view.

Emma sighs as she zips up the front of her tracksuit.

Emma stops short of zipping her tracksuit up all the way. She looks uncharacteristically surprised.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"Huh. I'd never realized you'd considered me to be worth admiring."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, sure. I mean, there's a lot to be impressed by. A lot to love."<</Dialogue>>

<<if $emmaDateFlirty > $emmaDateFriendly and $emmaDateFliry > $emmaDateProfessional>>Emma brings a hand up to your face and gently brushes a thumb against your cheek. What's even more surprising than the gesture is the softness of the smile on her face.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"I'm happy to have had this chance, <<print $playerFirstName>>."<</Dialogue>>

And with nothing more than that, she turns and makes her way out, leaving you a bit too stunned to follow after.

<<Dialogue "EmmaFitness" "Emma">>"It means a lot to have your support, <<print $playerFirstName>>. Thank you."<</Dialogue>>

You nod in return.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Thank you. Whatever you're after with this whole fitness thing, I hope you get it."<</Dialogue>>

She gives you another nod and a quick pat before turning on her heel and exiting. You gather up your things quickly in hopes of seeing her off, but she's gone before you can find her again.

She's walking off before you can respond again. You try to catch her on the way out, but you don't see her again. You must have missed her.<</if>>

With this behind you, there is nothing to do but to reflect on this, and head home. Tomorrow at work things will feel much the same, but also different. You wonder when you'll get a moment of intimacy with Emma again, but you can't help but feel like she decides that more than you.

:: ElenaDate2Start {"position":"1500,3500","size":"100,100"}

You see the magnificent building of the Natural History Museum in the distance, its classical architecture contrasting with the small town feel of its surroundings, and you find yourself accelerating your pace unconsciously - feelings of anxiety and excitement bubbling in your stomach. As you approach, you recognize the large figure of Elena waiting for you, reading a hardbound book on the steps of the building. It’s very refreshing to see her so concentrated on her reading, as she exudes this aura of peace and concentration that is very refreshing - when she’s at the gym, she’s usually alternating between a very intense focus and jittery nervousness about being watched. Here, she’s just calm and chill, like the rest of the world isn’t even there - but still heavily invested on the book, with a hint of delight. It’s hard to put in words, but this happier, freer Elena is just… centered and content.

Elena is wearing a flowy summer dress with a blue-and-yellow pattern of hummingbirds, which is surprisingly baggy despite her size, since she couldn’t find something that fits her well. The windy day is making her hair and dress fly and flow, giving her a wispy, almost ethereal feel that contrasts sharply with her bulky and firm muscles. It’s almost like the dress is caringly caressing her flesh, giving her enormous silhouette an inexplicable weightless appearance.

As you approach, she puts the book away in her comically small purse (or at least it looks that way given the size difference) and waves at you with a smile.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, Elena. You look pretty cute in that."<</Dialogue>>

She stammers, her usual nervousness coming back to the surface:
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Davvero? Per niente!"<</Dialogue>>

She says, waving her hands in front of her.
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I have NO idea what you just said, but from your face, I’m going to guess you just modestly disagreed..."<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"It’s just… it is so difficile - difficult - to find clothes that fit me… this looks like a sacco di patate… a potato sack… on me!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Nonsense - I mean, yeah, this needs some tapering at your tiny waist. I would say that I can only imagine how hard it is for you to find clothes but…"<</Dialogue>>

You move your hands from your head to your thighs, as if presenting your entire body as evidence in court.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I might just an idea or two about what it’s like getting clothes for you."<</Dialogue>>

You finish the thought with a smile. Still, she looks at your attire and tries to come up with a similar compliment, but it’s clear that she’s struggling a bit. 
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Ah, si… your… uh… <<print $outfit.top().name>>... it… is… cool?"<</Dialogue>>

You laugh and tap her back, and Elena quickly joins with her own awkward laugh.

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Shall we go in?"<</Dialogue>>

Elena nods, and grabs two tickets from her purse - apparently she had this figured out already.
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You paid for my ticket? You really didn’t have to!"<</Dialogue>>

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Per sogno!"<</Dialogue>>

She says, quite emphatically, and frowns with an almost indignant expression, making it clear that it would be an affront to try and pay her back for it. 
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You win this one! But I’ll get the next one, then! Uh… thank you, though, that was really sweet!"<</Dialogue>>

You smile, and wave your hand towards the museum entrance with a formal bow. The big girl giggles and excitedly walks up the stairs, with you following right behind.

Elena pauses briefly in front of the revolving door, realizing it will be a major struggle to try and make it through that. But you came prepared, and you open the handicapped door for her, trying to muster your most cavalier expression as you once again wave her in. Elena blushes, and you guess she isn’t quite used to people treating her gentlemanly - but she sure seems to appreciate it.

As you follow her inside, your eyes take a second to adjust from the bright sunny morning light to the subdued and dark interior… and all you can see is Elena, mouth agape as she looks up to the spacious entrance foyer. Her neck cranes as she absorbs the large room, looking very impressed. Initially, you wonder if the museums in Italy just aren’t as nice, which makes no sense to you. But then it dawns on you - it might just be the first time that she didn’t feel cramped inside a public building since her growth. You decide to give her a second to take all of that in, as she seems to really be enjoying herself.

As the wonder subsides, you place an arm around her shoulder, still in silence. Elena has a momentary flinch, almost like your touch zapped her with a static shock… but then she quickly relaxes, her tense shoulders slowly melting under your fingers. You amicably walk her towards the person checking tickets, like any two platonic friends would. The teenage boy seems just like any other bored summer worker, eyes glued to his phone and not really caring much about his task. But as you hand him the pair of tickets, you see his eyes following your wrist, up your arm and just getting shocked at the two gigantic females, dropping his phone to the ground. This clearly makes Elena uncomfortable, so you intervene:

<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m sorry, I guess everyone is doing e-tickets nowadays. We’re sort of old-fashioned… but I like saving paper ticket stubs as mementos."<</Dialogue>>

Elena looks at you, as you hand her one of the stubs, and she presses it against her ample bosom like you just gave her the world’s most precious treasure. As you walk away, she gets her book from her purse and opens the last page, where a dry white chrysanthemum rests, and she stores the stub there alongside it, before returning the tome with a satisfied smile.

The two of you walk through the large gallery, and follow the signs that lead to the flower exhibit - which is being held in a greenhouse attached to the back of the museum. To get there, you pass through the prehistory hall, which is just ahead.

This even darker room is filled with dinosaur fossils and bright dioramas, feeling a bit like a movie theater. And once again Elena’s head turns around, trying to take it all in. However, there’s a weird melancholy in her expression now. 
<<if $shyConfident > 0>>
    You grab her hand and give it a tight squeeze. She sighs, and you can see she wants to explain, but it doesn’t come easy to her.

<<else>>
    You take a step forward, getting closer to her - but giving her space to share what is eating her. It doesn’t take long for her to create the courage to voice her thoughts.

<</if>>
Still processing everything, she walks over to a sign that talks about the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event - when an asteroid impact changed the environment and led to their downfall.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Isn’t it crazy? They were molto grande - very big - I actually feel small next to them… eppure… uh… and yet… they just vanished completely. All of them. The most precario link in the tapestry of life.<</Dialogue>>

It hits you like a club, making you feel quite dumb for not realizing that before: Elena’s size doesn’t make her feel powerful… but the opposite. You can see how looking at these creatures brings anguish to her.



<span id="choice">
	<<link "But they did rule the Earth while they were around, right?">>
		<<replace "#choice">>
            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sure, they disappeared - but don’t people say they ruled the Earth before that? It must count for something, right?"<</Dialogue>>

            Elena crosses her arms and slumps her shoulders. It’s pretty obvious that she has no interest to leverage her strength to do any conquering - and that you should have kept your stupid mouth shut. You stop in your tracks as she keeps going, and you realize you need to clean up that mess. With some quick thinking, you increase your pace to catch up to her, and you give her a hug from behind - making her entire body tense and get quite uncomfortable. 
            <<if $shyConfident >= 0>>
                You nuzzle her neck, a glaring display of affection with the intent of making her feel better, but Elena just isn’t in the right mood. She is still tense, but now also turtling - not quite confident enough to tell you to stop, but the message comes across clearly anyway. You open your arms, letting her go - and Elena just steps forward in a bit of a hurry. You sigh, frustrated… all you wanted was to comfort her, but apparently she isn’t quite ready for that yet.

                You try to distract her, pointing out some of the dinosaurs you find the coolest and spouting some random trivia, but Elena just feels… distant. She is stuck in her thoughts, an impenetrable and inscrutable mind fortress that you would do anything to have a peek into. But how?

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Did you know that the fossilized bones are actually made of mineral rock, there’s actually no trace of the bone itself?"<</Dialogue>>

                Elena nods absentmindedly, her introverted nature starting to make you feel uncomfortable. You raise a hand to put on her shoulder, but end up pulling it back. You run ahead of her towards the large T-Rex skeleton in the middle of room, making sure to stay under its spotlight, and you try your best to imitate its short hands by folding your arms in front of you, with your hands near your shoulders like you had no arms, and start impersonating the creature with big teeth snapping motions and comical grunts.

                This elicits a giggle from Elena, who approaches and claps in congratulations for your little clownish display.

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Your turn. Pick one!"<</Dialogue>>

                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Ma che?!?<</Dialogue>>

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Come on! I want to see YOUR dinosaur impersonation!"<</Dialogue>>

                The girl just blushes and crosses her legs, holding her arms behind her back shyly. You give her arm a tap, and show her a big sign that has a chart with several different dinosaurs. You eventually tire Elena down into submission, and she looks intently at the chart, and a lightbulb goes off - she points at the apatosaurus, with a subtle but proud smile.

                You take a step back with a big grin, and watch as she sort of curves her back forward, lowering her arms a bit to pretend to be a quadruped, while she makes the silliest face and pretends to munch on a philodendron. You burst out laughing at how cute she looks, and she gets uncomfortable for a second… but then realizes how silly the whole thing is and she starts to giggle herself.

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I’m sorry, Elena, I think you might just have to stick to being a human - the dinosaur life just isn’t for you!"<</Dialogue>>

                At the very least, you seem to have distracted her a bit from her concern. You make your way towards the back of the exhibit, reaching for the door that leads out.


            <<else>>
                That was not what you intended, but you are not quite backing down yet. And so you whisper, gently:

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"The thing is… strength is not only for imposing your will. You can also use it to protect those you care about."<</Dialogue>>

                You can feel Elena’s rock-hard muscles slowly relaxing under your embrace, as her tension seems to disarm under your touch. She puts her hand on top of yours and sighs, and you open your arms, letting her go. She walks a couple of steps, then turns around with a sad smile.

                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You are right. There are precious things that need to be protected. Credo che… I suppose… strength does become useful for that, dopo tutto.<</Dialogue>>

                She stops in front of one of the dioramas, in which a model stegosaurus sits in front of a bunch of eggs. You see her resting one hand over her upper arm, looking pensive at the motherly reptile reproduction in front of her. You place your arm around her shoulder, but this time there is no tension or jerking - just a long sigh.

                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"There are several tipi of strength. Physical strength, sure. But it doesn’t do much by itself, does it? When the time comes and I have to protect something… will I have the other strength to do anything?<</Dialogue>>

                As you two look at the diorama, you put a hand on your chest, and say calmly without looking at Elena:

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Real strength? I think it comes from the heart. It’s that emotion, love and caring, that allows us to do the impossible for those we need to protect. You don’t need to have big muscles to do incredible things when you have love. You know what they say, “love can move mountains”. Good luck trying to do that with muscles."<</Dialogue>>

                Elena’s face turns towards you. You can see her eyes admiring you, like you somehow unlocked the secrets of the universe for her. It makes you laugh.

                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, sometimes I get carried away with platitudes, I’m kinda corny that way!"<</Dialogue>>

                You say, embarrassed, with a hand on the back of your head.

                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"No… that was very molto saggio… very wise. But… what does that have to do with corn?<</Dialogue>>

                You burst into laughter, and she looks downright confused as you proceed to explain what “corny” means, while the two of you leave the prehistoric room.

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Well, sure, a lot of the dinosaurs were big, especially compared to other creatures of that time. But… dinosaurs weren’t only defined by their size. Not only there were small ones…"<</Dialogue>>

            You point to a diorama that features an Aquilops, not bigger than a house cat.

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But there’s so much more to them - not everything that was big was a dinosaur - and the extinction certainly affected many creatures that were not dinosaurs. But you know what I like the most about them? There is so much to find out when you take the time to investigate!"<</Dialogue>>

            You point her to one diorama that discusses theories of hot-blooded dinosaurs, feathered dinosaurs…

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"We only have these fossils to go by, but the more we look, we find out all kinds of secrets. Sure, it’s easy to think about a violent T-Rex, but we probably had gentle giants like…"<</Dialogue>>

            You approach a sign that shows the scale of a Brachiosaurus. The exhibit has a reproduction of one of its legs for scale, and it’s taller than Elena.

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"These guys? Herbivores. Didn’t even eat meat. Can you imagine? Grazing a field like a goddamn prehistoric cow. Imagine of these just licking you!"<</Dialogue>>

            Elena is dumbfounded, like you somehow did a magic trick and changed reality in front of her eyes. She is still looking at the giant fossils in front of her, but now with a weird child-like glee, like they could be enormous puppies instead of ferocious monsters. That idea seems to bring warmth deep inside her, allowing her to enjoy the entire exhibit under a completely new perspective… which you secretly hope she also applies to the way she perceives herself.

            <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Besides, you know… the asteroid DID wipe out A LOT of stuff that wasn’t dinosaurs or big. It says right here that it killed three quarters of all plant and animal life… it affected PLANKTON! Do you know how small those are?"<</Dialogue>>

            Elena does a spin, looking at the entire exhibit, and then she rests her head on your shoulder, contemplative.

            <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie, <<print $playerFirstName>>. It is not everyday that I find new enjoyment in things. Now… I feel like dinosaurs are going to make me smile every time I see one…"<</Dialogue>>

            You wrap an arm around her waist, and she lets out a content sigh. You decide to let her savor this moment a bit more before you accompany her out of the dinosaur room, the two of you sharing a happy, if subdued, smile.

:: ElenaDateCafetaria {"position":"1500,3600","size":"100,100"}
As you leave the darkened dinosaur room, you are surprised by a small external garden cafeteria that is quite pleasant. The mixed smell of coffee and bread makes Elena’s stomach grumble, and you turn to see her embarrassed face.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Scusi, it took me longer to pick my clothes this morning, I ended up not having breakfast…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her voice speeds up as she tries to justify herself as if she has just committed a huge sin, and it takes every fiber of your being to not squish her cheeks or laugh. It seems like she’s really hungry, though…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, I sort of invited you, why don’t you let me treat you to a snack, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena tries to politely decline, but your insistence beats her in the end. She casually pulls up one of the ornate iron garden chairs away from the iron garden table so she can actually fit (you are pretty sure those were not supposed to be moved due to their hefty weight, but you aren’t about to bring that detail to her attention, as the metal slightly groans while she sits down).<br><br>
As you reach the counter, you realize that there are quite a few options available - they apparently specialize in pastries, with all kinds of breads and sweet confections that look really yummy. Argh! Too many choices!!!<br><br>
OK, <<print $playerFirstName>>, you can do this! It’s just picking something for Elena, how hard can it really be?!?<br><br>


<span id="choice">
	<<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "I should go all out! Elena’s a growing girl, and I bet she would appreciate a snack tasting smorgasbord!">>
		<<replace "#choice">>
            <<if $money >= 100>>
                Before you know it, you are just pointing at several different pastries, and the poor attendant rushes to grab one after the other, placing them onto a tray… soon enough, she’s working on the third tray as you order almost one of every item available. Elena is, thankfully, too distracted appreciating the flora of the garden to see the small spectacle you are conducting at the counter. To top it off, you order a hot chocolate for yourself and a macchiato for her.<br><br>
                The attendant rings up your impulsive purchase, and you realize you truly went overboard when the total comes to 100 bucks… still… you feel like Elena deserves to be treated like a princess. So you don’t hesitate (well, maybe a little) as you pay for the order, and start trying to figure out the logistics on how to balance the three trays - on the bright side, they feel really light for your powerful arms!<br><br>
                You approach the table, a tray on each hand and balancing a third one between your arms, and once Elena notices, she immediately springs up, dropping the heavy chair back as she grabs two trays and sets them on the table. You do the same with the last one, and try to act gentlemanly as you pick up the chair and to help Elena sit down… except she is a bit stunned at your display of generosity.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Mio Dio, What… have you done? I… I don’t… you shouldn’t…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
At first, you assumed she was just being polite, but you can sense some shame, as she looks around, trying to see if anyone is looking at the two of you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Così tanto, that is too much!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her tone betrays her disapproval - she isn’t mad at you as much as she seems disappointed with the fact that she is painfully aware that she would easily eat all that… but would rather not do it in public (made especially obvious by her constant looking around). But you got this under control, as you confidently assure her:<br><br> 
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ah, chill down, Elena - it’s not everyday I get to go out to cool, swanky places with a cute girl, so why not splurge a little, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"C-cute…?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena blushes, the compliment successfully making her brain change gears, and you decide to break the ice by bringing attention to the plethora of options on the table.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I think you are going to love some of these - I got the coffee eclair, which looks really yummy - unless you want to start with something savory - these are Brazilian pão de queijo - they look like pastries, but they are actually gluten-free!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You continue to explain the option like a goddamn professor giving a lecture, and Elena’s shy hesitation slowly dissolves, replaced with a look of admiration - you are not sure if it’s your cosmopolitan selection of snacks (which, granted, you just memorized from the explanations the lady at the café gave you) or your generosity. Either way, she looks to be almost salivating at the options.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But what do I know? You are the foodie here - just pick something!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You smile, and Elena feels encouraged to try something. You see her sparkly eyes darting among the many options, until she spots a strawberry chiffon cake - and she picks it up very delicately. Bringing the plate right in front of her face, she spends a few seconds just admiring the craftsmanship of the beautiful confection - despite her hunger. She looks at you with begging eyes, as if seeking approval, and you just smile and nod.<br><br>
                The small plate and fork look even tinier in her big hands, but she very elegantly cuts a small piece of the cake, and brings it to her mouth. Instantly, her face is one of pure bliss, her legs tapping up and down like a little girl. The adorable display is almost too much for you to bear, but eventually she looks at you, still chewing, and brings a bite towards your mouth. You gulp the treat eagerly, but end up with some whipped cream on your nose. Without hesitation, Elena just brings a napkin and cleans it up… but then feels awkward about doing it without asking for permission, pulling the napkin back and shrinking into herself. For someone so big, she sure knows how to look absolutely adorable.<br><br>
                You decide to help yourself to a chicken empanada, grabbing a big bite before offering the other half to Elena while you munch happily, but she politely declines. While you dwell on the delicious seasoning of the steamy filling, you can’t help but notice that Elena is looking at you with eyes that hint at admiration and affection.<br><br>
                And that’s how two large girls quickly make short work of the snack-filled table. The culinary journey may not last long - but it leaves a big impression on the two of you. But as you finish the meal with a lone cherry, you notice Elena is looking at you quite wistfully.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s with the sad face?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, no, I’m quite content. It’s just… girls really shouldn’t eat this much…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You snort, amused.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I don’t think most girls who are concerned about their figure have washboard abs and legs that could uproot a tree, Elena. Heck, I bet you will burn these calories before we leave the museum!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena tries to argue back, with a vague point that it’s not about her physique but what is proper for a lady, but quickly realizes that you won’t concede this.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I suppose it feels good… to go all out sometimes."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"THAT’S the spirit!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The two of you stand up, and no longer hungry, and you happily escort Elena to the nearby greenhouse entrance where the flower exhibit is being held.<br><br>
                <<set $money -=100>>

                You check your wallet - and quickly realize that you won’t be able to get as many snacks as a big girl like Elena deserves. Disappointed, you settle for a tarte tatin and a macchiato, as well as some hot chocolate for yourself. You pay the attendant 15 dollars, and bring the tray back to the table.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh. That looks delizioso…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You sit by her side, with your hot chocolate in hand, and watch as she grabs the fork. She spends a few seconds just admiring the craftsmanship of the beautiful confection, despite her hunger.<br><br>
                The small plate and fork look even tinier in her big hands, but she very elegantly cuts a small piece of the pie, and brings it to her mouth. Instantly, her face is one of pure bliss, her legs tapping up and down like a little girl. The adorable display is almost too much for you to bear. But as she looks at you, her eyes widen, and she silently and awkwardly starts to point towards her own upper lip, confusing you. It takes a second to dawn on you that she’s trying to warn you that you have a ridiculous hot chocolate mustache, and you wipe it out with a napkin, calming her down - and making you laugh a bit.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I suppose we must look a bit ridiculous, you know, two big, strong, women… acting like little girls."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena, uncharacteristically, shrugs. With complete sincerity, she just replies:<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"But isn’t that what we are? Due ragazze… two girls."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You scratch your head, and realize that there is some deep wisdom in that. You’ve been growing so fast that you kinda forgot that you are still… you. You don’t need to act differently just because you can bench press a cow, society be damned. You aren’t gonna stop wearing frilly dresses just because some dude thinks you look manly.<br><br>
                Elena finishes the tarte, and you find yourself just admiring her feminine demeanor. She really lives by that mantra - under all that muscle, you can still clearly see the dainty girl, and it stirs something inside you.<br><br>
                She very elegantly wipes her mouth with a napkin and stands up, and you do the same. You offer an arm, and Elena gladly takes it as the two of you go towards the greenhouse where the flower exhibit is being held.<br><br>

            <<else>>
                You quickly look at your depressingly empty wallet, and realize you can’t really afford a snack. You feel miserable about it, and return to the table with empty hands and a defeated expression. Elena, however, is quick on the uptake, and realizes what happened. She stands up promptly, and goes to the counter. You try to stop her, but for once, she seems to not hesitate at all. Before you know, she comes back with a tray with two espressos and a couple of blueberry muffins - they don’t quite seem like the type of food she would usually… oh…<br><br>
                She got those thinking of you.<br><br>
                It’s your turn to blush, as you sit on the chair and silently munch on the treat. You find the black coffee a tad too bitter for your taste, especially in contrast to the dessert you just had, but drink it happily and say nothing. In fact, you find yourself more interested in just watching as Elena delicately peels the paper off the muffin, and takes tiny nibbles. She looks strangely elegant doing so, with her bites betraying the obvious scale difference between her and her treat. The whole process is hypnotizing, and eventually she comes to the realization that you are just staring - which makes HER blush, and you laugh.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>  
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"..."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You get back to your own muffin, feeling like a water buffalo in the way you eat it when compared to the lady next to you, but it doesn’t really bother you - it just increases your admiration for her. You really couldn’t think of anything you’d rather be doing than spending some time with her, differences be damned.<br><br>
                It doesn’t take too long for both of you to finish, and you try to be gentlemanly and dispose of the trash while she cleans the crumbs off her dress, and the two of you make your way to the greenhouse.<br><br>

                Oh, man! There are SO MANY OPTIONS!!! You start looking at the sweets, because they remind you of Elena’s demeanor… but then you remember just how refined her tastes are and start second-guessing yourself.

            <<if $money >= 10>>
                Frankly, it’s sort of amazing that this array of foodstuffs isn’t part of a museum exhibit - it would be right at home on an art museum… but this is a natural history museum, and this is the café, and there are pricetags by the items. So you still fall back to your sense of aesthetics more so than your culinary gifts when you pick an exquisite tarte tatin for Elena, coupled with an espresso as part of a promotional deal. You settle for a hot chocolate for yourself, and quickly return to the table with the items.<br><br>
                Elena is distracted, looking at the beautiful sunlight garden, and you serve her meal with a big smile. She seems very pleased at your selection.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, that looks delicious. Grazie."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You have a silly smirk on your face. Somehow, her rather plain praise is enough to make you fuzzy inside, just as much as the cute way in which she grabs the miniscule fork - made even smaller by the obvious scale disparity - and starts to cut tiny pieces of the mini-pie. You can’t shake this feeling of being two girls playing with doll-sized props, and the mere idea makes you chuckle. This, in turn, makes Elena self-conscious, looking at you confused and somewhat embarrassed.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, no, sorry… it was just… I…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You almost start explaining your logic, but then realize that maybe it’s better not to bring up her size after the whole discussion regarding dinosaurs, so you just improvise a bit.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I just… remembered something funny, that’s all!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh. What’s that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Stuttering, you try to get out of the trap you just laid out for yourself.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you know, I’ve been trying to teach myself cooking lately… yeah! And I… uh… made a mess trying to make a pie. Boy, am I clumsy! I just… flour everywhere. I even dropped an egg on the flour. He… hehe… he…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena gives a genuine amused smile, and part of you feels guilty for the misdirection, but that’s a small price to pay for that beautiful smile. Her teeth (which you don’t get to see that often) shine as she does, much like her brown hair against the sun. It makes you melt from the inside. You find yourself joining her with giggles, and you take a sip of your delicious hot chocolate.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I’m such a klutz!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena is confused by the word, which you explain, is a synonym for fool. She takes immediate umbrage at that.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You are not a fool. You are very smart and caring."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The conviction and sincerity in her voice is… touching. You are left speechless, your off-hand remark being less about self-loathing and more like a jest but… Elena clearly took it very seriously. You can see real concern in her eyes, and it cuts through your heart like a dagger. You take a few seconds just to compose yourself before you can reply.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, no, I was just joking."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You shouldn’t joke about that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                It’s… weird. She’s not chastising you, it comes from a real place of concern. And you just aren’t used to seeing this more assertive side of Elena. It’s… refreshing? No, it actually makes something stir inside of you, something you can’t quite describe. You admire her for it.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I… I won’t."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The two of you finish your respective drinks in silence, and you notice your heartbeat is faster than usual. Why is this whole thing making you feel this way? You twiddle your fingers nervously as Elena takes her sweet time finishing her espresso, making you unusually anxious. As she does so, you get up immediately, and Elena follows, grabbing your hand - which makes your heart race even faster. She leads you to the greenhouse, and you find yourself almost panting.<br><br>
                What ARE these feelings that Elena is surfacing on you?<br><br>
                And thus, the two of you make your way to the flower exhibit.<br><br>

:: ElenaDate2Cafetaria {"position":"1500,3700","size":"100,100"}
As you leave the darkened dinosaur room, you are surprised by a small external garden cafeteria that is quite pleasant. The mixed smell of coffee and bread makes Elena’s stomach grumble, and you turn to see her embarrassed face.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Scusi, it took me longer to pick my clothes this morning, I ended up not having breakfast…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her voice speeds up as she tries to justify herself as if she has just committed a huge sin, and it takes every fiber of your being to not squish her cheeks or laugh. It seems like she’s really hungry, though…<br><br>
<<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, I sort of invited you, why don’t you let me treat you to a snack, huh?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Elena tries to politely decline, but your insistence beats her in the end. She casually pulls up one of the ornate iron garden chairs away from the iron garden table so she can actually fit (you are pretty sure those were not supposed to be moved due to their hefty weight, but you aren’t about to bring that detail to her attention, as the metal slightly groans while she sits down).<br><br>
As you reach the counter, you realize that there are quite a few options available - they apparently specialize in pastries, with all kinds of breads and sweet confections that look really yummy. Argh! Too many choices!!!<br><br>
OK, <<print $playerFirstName>>, you can do this! It’s just picking something for Elena, how hard can it really be?!?<br><br>


<span id="choice">
	<<PersonalityCheck $shyConfident >= 2 "I should go all out! Elena’s a growing girl, and I bet she would appreciate a snack tasting smorgasbord!">>
		<<replace "#choice">>
            <<if $money >= 100>>
                Before you know it, you are just pointing at several different pastries, and the poor attendant rushes to grab one after the other, placing them onto a tray… soon enough, she’s working on the third tray as you order almost one of every item available. Elena is, thankfully, too distracted appreciating the flora of the garden to see the small spectacle you are conducting at the counter. To top it off, you order a hot chocolate for yourself and a macchiato for her.<br><br>
                The attendant rings up your impulsive purchase, and you realize you truly went overboard when the total comes to 100 bucks… still… you feel like Elena deserves to be treated like a princess. So you don’t hesitate (well, maybe a little) as you pay for the order, and start trying to figure out the logistics on how to balance the three trays - on the bright side, they feel really light for your powerful arms!<br><br>
                You approach the table, a tray on each hand and balancing a third one between your arms, and once Elena notices, she immediately springs up, dropping the heavy chair back as she grabs two trays and sets them on the table. You do the same with the last one, and try to act gentlemanly as you pick up the chair and to help Elena sit down… except she is a bit stunned at your display of generosity.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Mio Dio, What… have you done? I… I don’t… you shouldn’t…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
At first, you assumed she was just being polite, but you can sense some shame, as she looks around, trying to see if anyone is looking at the two of you.<br><br>
<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Così tanto, that is too much!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
Her tone betrays her disapproval - she isn’t mad at you as much as she seems disappointed with the fact that she is painfully aware that she would easily eat all that… but would rather not do it in public (made especially obvious by her constant looking around). But you got this under control, as you confidently assure her:<br><br> 
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Ah, chill down, Elena - it’s not everyday I get to go out to cool, swanky places with a cute girl, so why not splurge a little, right?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"C-cute…?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena blushes, the compliment successfully making her brain change gears, and you decide to break the ice by bringing attention to the plethora of options on the table.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I think you are going to love some of these - I got the coffee eclair, which looks really yummy - unless you want to start with something savory - these are Brazilian pão de queijo - they look like pastries, but they are actually gluten-free!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You continue to explain the option like a goddamn professor giving a lecture, and Elena’s shy hesitation slowly dissolves, replaced with a look of admiration - you are not sure if it’s your cosmopolitan selection of snacks (which, granted, you just memorized from the explanations the lady at the café gave you) or your generosity. Either way, she looks to be almost salivating at the options.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"But what do I know? You are the foodie here - just pick something!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You smile, and Elena feels encouraged to try something. You see her sparkly eyes darting among the many options, until she spots a strawberry chiffon cake - and she picks it up very delicately. Bringing the plate right in front of her face, she spends a few seconds just admiring the craftsmanship of the beautiful confection - despite her hunger. She looks at you with begging eyes, as if seeking approval, and you just smile and nod.<br><br>
                The small plate and fork look even tinier in her big hands, but she very elegantly cuts a small piece of the cake, and brings it to her mouth. Instantly, her face is one of pure bliss, her legs tapping up and down like a little girl. The adorable display is almost too much for you to bear, but eventually she looks at you, still chewing, and brings a bite towards your mouth. You gulp the treat eagerly, but end up with some whipped cream on your nose. Without hesitation, Elena just brings a napkin and cleans it up… but then feels awkward about doing it without asking for permission, pulling the napkin back and shrinking into herself. For someone so big, she sure knows how to look absolutely adorable.<br><br>
                You decide to help yourself to a chicken empanada, grabbing a big bite before offering the other half to Elena while you munch happily, but she politely declines. While you dwell on the delicious seasoning of the steamy filling, you can’t help but notice that Elena is looking at you with eyes that hint at admiration and affection.<br><br>
                And that’s how two large girls quickly make short work of the snack-filled table. The culinary journey may not last long - but it leaves a big impression on the two of you. But as you finish the meal with a lone cherry, you notice Elena is looking at you quite wistfully.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"What’s with the sad face?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, no, I’m quite content. It’s just… girls really shouldn’t eat this much…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You snort, amused.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I don’t think most girls who are concerned about their figure have washboard abs and legs that could uproot a tree, Elena. Heck, I bet you will burn these calories before we leave the museum!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena tries to argue back, with a vague point that it’s not about her physique but what is proper for a lady, but quickly realizes that you won’t concede this.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I suppose it feels good… to go all out sometimes."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"THAT’S the spirit!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The two of you stand up, and no longer hungry, and you happily escort Elena to the nearby greenhouse entrance where the flower exhibit is being held.<br><br>
                <<set $money -=100>>

            <<elseif $money >= 15>>
                You check your wallet - and quickly realize that you won’t be able to get as many snacks as a big girl like Elena deserves. Disappointed, you settle for a tarte tatin and a macchiato, as well as some hot chocolate for yourself. You pay the attendant 15 dollars, and bring the tray back to the table.<br><br>

                Frankly, it’s sort of amazing that this array of foodstuffs isn’t part of a museum exhibit - it would be right at home on an art museum… but this is a natural history museum, and this is the café, and there are pricetags by the items. So you still fall back to your sense of aesthetics more so than your culinary gifts when you pick an exquisite tarte tatin for Elena, coupled with an espresso as part of a promotional deal. You settle for a hot chocolate for yourself, and quickly return to the table with the items.<br><br>
                Elena is distracted, looking at the beautiful sunlight garden, and you serve her meal with a big smile. She seems very pleased at your selection.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"<<print $playerFirstName>>, that looks delicious. Grazie."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You have a silly smirk on your face. Somehow, her rather plain praise is enough to make you fuzzy inside, just as much as the cute way in which she grabs the miniscule fork - made even smaller by the obvious scale disparity - and starts to cut tiny pieces of the mini-pie. You can’t shake this feeling of being two girls playing with doll-sized props, and the mere idea makes you chuckle. This, in turn, makes Elena self-conscious, looking at you confused and somewhat embarrassed.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"No, no, sorry… it was just… I…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                You almost start explaining your logic, but then realize that maybe it’s better not to bring up her size after the whole discussion regarding dinosaurs, so you just improvise a bit.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I just… remembered something funny, that’s all!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh. What’s that?"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Stuttering, you try to get out of the trap you just laid out for yourself.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, you know, I’ve been trying to teach myself cooking lately… yeah! And I… uh… made a mess trying to make a pie. Boy, am I clumsy! I just… flour everywhere. I even dropped an egg on the flour. He… hehe… he…"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena gives a genuine amused smile, and part of you feels guilty for the misdirection, but that’s a small price to pay for that beautiful smile. Her teeth (which you don’t get to see that often) shine as she does, much like her brown hair against the sun. It makes you melt from the inside. You find yourself joining her with giggles, and you take a sip of your delicious hot chocolate.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Yeah, I’m such a klutz!"<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                Elena is confused by the word, which you explain, is a synonym for fool. She takes immediate umbrage at that.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You are not a fool. You are very smart and caring."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The conviction and sincerity in her voice is… touching. You are left speechless, your off-hand remark being less about self-loathing and more like a jest but… Elena clearly took it very seriously. You can see real concern in her eyes, and it cuts through your heart like a dagger. You take a few seconds just to compose yourself before you can reply.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Oh, no, I was just joking."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"You shouldn’t joke about that."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                It’s… weird. She’s not chastising you, it comes from a real place of concern. And you just aren’t used to seeing this more assertive side of Elena. It’s… refreshing? No, it actually makes something stir inside of you, something you can’t quite describe. You admire her for it.<br><br>
                <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I… I won’t."<</Dialogue>><br><br>
                The two of you finish your respective drinks in silence, and you notice your heartbeat is faster than usual. Why is this whole thing making you feel this way? You twiddle your fingers nervously as Elena takes her sweet time finishing her espresso, making you unusually anxious. As she does so, you get up immediately, and Elena follows, grabbing your hand - which makes your heart race even faster. She leads you to the greenhouse, and you find yourself almost panting.<br><br>
                What ARE these feelings that Elena is surfacing on you?<br><br>
                And thus, the two of you make your way to the flower exhibit.<br><br>
                <<set $money -=10>>

            <<else>>
                Oh wait… you just remembered - you don’t really have enough money to afford a snack for the two of you. Resigned, you come back to the table and apologize profusely, which starts a whole vicious cycle of apologies from her end. After this recursive loop that makes it feel like some sort of Canadian sport, the two of you eventually run out of things to apologize for, and awkwardly (and hungrily) move on to the greenhouse for the exhibit proper.<br><br>

:: ElenaDate2GreenHouse {"position":"1500,3800","size":"100,100"}
Having crossed the garden, you arrive at the little plastic tent that acts as an airlock of sorts for the greenhouse. The structure confuses you regarding its purpose as you open the flaps, and some hunching over is necessary to make it in. It is when you open the glass doors to the greenhouse proper that you realize what its true need is:

They also have a large live butterfly exhibit within the space. As your eyes focus inside, the enormous greenhouse is rife with the flying creatures, giving the space a surreal fairy-tale ambiance, like you just walked into a magic kingdom straight out of a book.

Elena squeezes your hand, and you find yourself blushing into a deep shade of red - so it’s a good thing she’s so taken by the fauna and flora, looking around with her mouth agape. You are also slightly out of breath, not so much from the magnificent sight… but from the emotions being brought by her casual physical contact.

Almost entranced, Elena pulls you by the hand as she spots a Vietnamese lotus, which is a beautiful pink bloom, almost a caricature of what you would expect of a flower. She squeezes your hand quite hard in excitement, and you thank the gods that you have the strength to withstand the pressure applied - you are pretty sure she would have broken Johan’s hand with that.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Look at this lotus… è bellissima."<</Dialogue>>

Her excitement is contagious - Sure, the flower IS beautiful. But as you look at her enchanted face, you find yourself quickly forgetting about the flower. You don’t get to see Elena in such a joyous mood often, and it sure is breathtaking. She proceeds to drag you around the greenhouse, and you feel like a princess being escorted in a children’s story. Elena gives long and detailed explanations about each flower, Italian words slowly slipping in with more frequency as she takes you from bloom to bloom - and soon she’s basically speaking only in her native language. But it doesn’t matter - her happiness speaks volumes louder than any words could ever do justice, and it makes you feel incredibly warm inside.

The whole experience is dreamlike, from the morning sunlight coming in refracted beams through the glass, to the swarms of colorful butterflies casually fluttering about. Time becomes abstract, and you just find yourself basking on the entire experience with a huge smile.

Eventually, Elena freezes. She looks into the distance, and her jaw drops. She lets go of your hand, and rushes away. The childish outburst only makes her more endearing, and you lazily follow her, finding her next to the giant orchid from the pamphlet. You approach, looking at the sign that proudly presents the Grammatophyllum speciosum - but the real surprise is that the plant actually dwarves Elena, this specimen being a few heads taller than her.

Still, you watch as she admires the plant, absolutely entranced, you can’t help but feel a strange kinship between the two - not only is this plant nothing sort of gigantic - but its yellow and red tones actually compliment Elena incredibly well, like they were made for each other. You decide to stay back and let her have this moment, which seems like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of deal to her. And frankly… witnessing it is nothing short of a blessing for you.


<<if $shyConfident >= 1>>
    You approach Elena, tenderly hugging her from behind. While she doesn’t tense nor tries to break free, she also seems to be absorbed by this nigh-religious experience to truly notice you. Still, you enjoy this rare opportunity to feel Elena’s warmth, her soft skin and its stark contrast to the firm layers of sinew and muscle. It feels so good you don’t even mind the fact that she’s not reciprocating the affection - but that acknowledgement still does linger subconsciously on your mind, like a pea under the mattress that you can’t really feel, but is aware of nonetheless.
    You can somehow sense that Elena is on the verge of tears, and you tighten the hug, and that seems to spark something in her. She still isn’t tensing or trying to get free, but it’s as if she is awkward and uncertain on how to respond to that. She motions to put her hand over yours, which is laying on her cobbled abdomen, but after a brief touch she pulls it away and moves her hair out of her face, and you can feel her breathing getting a bit more ragged.

    You decide for both of your sakes to step on the brakes, and you let go. Elena turns, still looking somewhat lost, and she now grabs your hand with actual affectionate intent, and a joyous smile just explodes on your face. Elena’s eyes dart everywhere, and you bring her to a nearby park bench, where the two of you can sit, side by side. 

<<else>>
    You find one of the park benches and sit, elbows resting on your knees and your chin on your hands, and you just admire this beautiful, caring human being. There’s a hint of pain in knowing that most people can only see a giantess that could kill them on a whim, while it’s so blatantly obvious to you that this is the gentlest person you’ve ever met. If you weren’t in such a content mood, the sheer injustice of it might really be souring your mood. And yet, you are happy to just kick back and admire this beautiful person, quirks and all, feeling blessed to be able to call her a friend.

    While you could easily spend the rest of the day doing so, Elena eventually notices that you aren’t around, and hurries to the join you on the bench, apologizing for her distraction.

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Scusi. I… didn’t even notice you had sat down. It’s just that…"<</Dialogue>>

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, it’s okay, Elena. This is how I’m enjoying this. No worries, really."<</Dialogue>>
 
<</if>>
Elena puts her hands daintily on her lap, blushing slightly, but it doesn’t take long for her to realize how happy you seem to be, and she relaxes again. And as her worries melt away, she goes back into her own contemplative mood just as the sun perfectly hits her brown hair, projecting a halo around her head in its hazy glory. And on cue a beautiful blue butterfly lands on her flowery headband, very slowly opening and closing its wings. The image could not be any more perfect if it was painted by a renaissance master - you get lost in Elena's golden eyes as they lovingly gaze around, her mouth slightly open, with bright red lips that are so incredibly inviting…


<<if $shyConfident >= 2 || $submissiveDominant >= 2>>  
    As if commanded by an invisible force, you place a hand on Elena’s cheek and turn her face towards yours, and place a quick peck on her lips. It all happens so fast that the awareness of your act really only dawns after it’s already over, but while you regret nothing, Elena seems downright shocked - not like revolt or disgust, just something entirely unexpected. You look at her, your expression making it crystal clear that you regret nothing. Elena continues to fight her internal struggle - you can see in her huge eyes a little part of her that wants to give in, return the kiss… but it seems to be losing to that sheltered child, afraid to get hurt or hurt others, that constantly puts up emotional shields as thick as her muscles. The battle eventually is settled as she stands up and walks away in a hurry, and you can hear her sobbing.

    You follow her, and grab her by the hand. She tries to pull it away gently, but you use all your might to keep her from doing so. With absolute earnesty, you announce, your own voice filled with regret.

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Elena, I’m sorry I don’t know what came over me."<</Dialogue>>

    She turns to look at you, teary-eyed.

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"No. Io… mi scuzi, non lo so…"<</Dialogue>>

    You watch as she struggles with her words, and it breaks your heart. You gently place a hand on her shoulder and shush her. It seems to help her settle down a bit, and she gathers her wits.

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Sorry. I didn’t mean to react like that. It… felt nice. I’m not just quite ready… questo è tutto."<</Dialogue>>

    You smile, and reinforce that it’s okay. Elena hugs you, resting her head on your shoulder, as she whispers:

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie."<</Dialogue>>

    You just stay there, as if time itself had frozen, and feel a sense of peace take over the two of you.
     

<<elseif $shyConfident >= 0>>
    In what can almost be described as an out of body experience, your own lips just slowly start approaching Elena’s face, your own lips parting to mimic hers, as you close your eyes and feel the softness of her lips against hers. Time feels like it comes to a stop, even as the contact lasts for less than a split second, but it feels like… heaven. And as you reopen your eyes, returning to your own body, you see Elena’s own eyes open wide, a mix of surprise and panic.

    As the sense and awareness rush back into your mind, you feel like your heart stops, and so does your breathing. Oh, no! What have you done? Thoughts cross your mind faster than you can process them, and you almost freak out trying to establish what to do next - do you apologize? Feign confusion? Pretend nothing happened? Run awa…

    But then… Elena smiles, looks away and puts her hand on yours, squeezing it with incredible affection. Your heart almost jumps out of your mouth, but her presence is so soothing… so relaxing… that you find yourself just settling into this peaceful aura of happiness.

    If only for a few precious moments, all is good in the world.
 
<<else>> 

    You can’t take your eyes from the plump red lips, inviting and sweet as ripe vesuvio cherry tomatoes. You find your own lips mimicking the half-open position as deep feelings stir deep within you. Your breath becomes deeper, and eventually Elena notices your expression - but you are so mesmerized that you are completely oblivious to it. But instead of recoiling, she stares deep into your eyes as she works her own courage and plants the tenderest kiss you can conceive of on your lips.

    The world vanishes around the two of you as you close your eyes. All that exists are two kindred souls, connected by the weird happenstance of disproportionate bodies that, frankly, might as well not even exist right now. As your lips part, you bask in the warm breath against your face, and after you open your eyes, you see Elena looking at you with the same longing that you are experiencing right now. But the expression is quickly replaced by a content smile, as she leans her head on your shoulder and holds your hand, sighing happily.

    If only for a few precious moments, all is good in the world.
  
<</if>>
But as an indeterminate amount of time passes, Elena is the first one to act.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Thank you so much, this exhibit was magical. I can’t ever repay you enough for dragging me here, mi fiore."<</Dialogue>>

Her eyes sparkle as she says the last two words, quite emphatically. You look at her quizzically, but she just smiles like a bird who just ate the canary.

<<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Oh, it’s nothing. Just a little nickname for you!"<</Dialogue>>

She walks ahead, and you make sure to catch up as you walk out of the greenhouse and towards the exit.

[[Continue|ElenaDate2GiftShop]]

:: ElenaDate2GiftShop {"position":"1500,3900","size":"100,100"}
The two of you walk back to the main foyer of the museum, hand in hand, and towards the gift shop that leads to the exit. Elena, like a little kid, is quickly attracted to some of the books dedicated to the exhibit, sporting several illustrations and pictures of the flowers. You watch as she leafs through them, when you hear something that at first sounds innocuous enough - but then quickly turns into panic as you think about it - a large group of children.

It would seem like your plan to avoid children was flawed, as a large school group stampedes into the gift shop. Before Elena can react, you grab her hand and hold it tightly, trying to be her island as you wait to see what happens next.

One of the kids just rushes blindly, running headfirst into Elena’s beefy thigh - and falling back on the ground. As the small boy opens his eyes, his head slowly tracks up, taking in the scale of the giantess in front of him, as Elena realizes what just happened and the other kids start crowding around her.

<<if $elenaOpinion > 40>>
    You brace yourself, expecting Elena to freeze or flee, but instead, she smiles, and reaches down with a gentle hand, and scoops up the kid as if he were entirely weightless, placing him down, now standing up. With wide-open eyes, the boy gives a thankful nod, and runs away. The other kids look in wonder, as if they have just witnessed a magical creature.

    Elena just smiles as she closes her eyes and tilts her head, and the kids all come running, begging her to lift and wave them around.

    Elena giggles and apologizes, explaining with a thick accent (which only leaves the kids more awed) that it’s not the proper place for that:

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"But who knows? Maybe we’ll meet at the park someday!"<</Dialogue>>

    The crowd cheers, and Elena carefully steps out of the store with you.

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"I have a sneaky feeling they will be telling stories about you for quite some time."<</Dialogue>>

    Elena nods and smiles, and it fills you with an indescribable happiness that she seems to own her size for once. Who knows, maybe she will even grow into it someday - you tell yourself, laughing out loud at your unintentional pun.

    But as the morning comes to an end, Elena thanks you one last time and, with a warm hug, says her goodbyes. You watch as she walks away, with a surprising spring to her step - as opposed to her usual hunched and careful gait. You shake your head, and turn the other way.
 

<<elseif $elenaOpinion > 20>>
    Elena gasps, but you squeeze her hand and nod, trying to convey that everything is fine. You sense hesitation in her hand, but she just takes a deep breath (which momentarily scares the kid) before asking, in surprisingly clear English:

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Are you hurt, dear?"<</Dialogue>>

    Her steady tone is incredibly soothing and reassuring, and the young boy’s fear seems to evaporate as he replies that he’s alright. Elena kneels and offers him her free hand, a single finger almost as big as the boy’s entire hand. And yet, he accepts, and she very gently envelops his palm in hers, lifting him so smoothly that he almost seems to be levitating.

    With a bright smile, she apologizes:

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Sorry, sometimes I forget my own size. Are you sure you are fine?"<</Dialogue>>

    The boy nervously nods his head, quickly and repeatedly, as his friends chatter excitedly.

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"You should all drink your milk to make sure that you grow to be big and strong as my friend!"<</Dialogue>>

    You motion Elena to make a muscle, and she blushes to what you could swear is a deep shade of purple, but she complies, showing a bicep that might just be bigger than most of their legs. This time, the children utter a unison of “wow”, while Elena hunches over herself. You can’t help but laugh at the surreal scene.

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"We need to go now, but you should behave - remember, no running inside the museum!"<</Dialogue>>

    As you wave goodbye and pull Elena by her hand out of the shop, she seems to be in a deep introspective mood, thinking to herself.

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Penny for your thoughts?"<</Dialogue>>

    Elena is at first confused by the idiom, which you quickly explain.

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Ah, si. No, I was just… sorpresa. They weren’t afraid of me."<</Dialogue>>

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Sorry to break it to you, Elena, the only way you would surprise me is if you willingly hurt an ant."<</Dialogue>>

    She keeps looking at her oversized hands as you escort her outside. You can see that something has triggered in her, and you give her a hug, while you tell her not to sweat about it. She gives a weak but sincere smile, and thanks you once again.

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie. This… was magical. I have no words."<</Dialogue>>

    <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Hey, I can say the same. Looking forward to another..."<</Dialogue>>

    You cut yourself before saying the word “date”. But the smiles on both of you say it all. You watch as Elena walks on her way, admiring her radiant beauty as you force yourself to turn around towards your own apartment.


<<else>>
    Elena tugs at your hand, and it takes all her willpower to suppress her fight or flight instinct - which is clearly 100% flight. But you hold her steady, feeling her palm getting sweaty. You assume it’s part of her empathic nature, but her terror seems to radiate and infect the children, which get just as panicked as she is - the boy scurrying away, as one of the other kids actually starts to cry.

    OK, <<print $playerFirstName>>, calm down, you got this. It feels like disarming a bomb in a movie, except more tense. Your eyes dart around, trying to take in the situation - do you concentrate on Elena? No, you should first soothe the kids - but how?


    <<if $shyConfident > 1 || $carefreeCarefull < -1>>
        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"It’s okay, she’s a GOOD giant! Kinda like… a superhero!"<</Dialogue>>

        Elena’s panic turns into utter confusion as she looks at you, complete bafflement all over her face. You muster the most confident smile you can, along with your best storytelling voice, as you proclaim loudly:

        <<Dialogue "player" "You">>"Don’t worry, we just made sure there are no monsters or bad guys here - they call us every now and then when there’s a pesky dinosaur!"<</Dialogue>>

        And there you have it - you can see the one kid that is entranced by your narrative, and like a wave, his energy flows into the others as he starts asking questions about the monsters and dinosaurs. You continue to weave a tall tale, and just like the kids, Elena is soothed by your dramatic chops. Soon there’s awed “Ooooh!”s and giggles all around, and you explain that the two of you need to get going because there are other monsters out there that need vanquishing.

        Elena, still somewhat dazed, just follows as you tug her out of the museum.


    <<else>>
        You take a deep breath, trying to find the focus to get out of this situation. You gently ask if the kid is okay, and he just nods, somewhat panicked like he had committed a heinous crime. You offer him a hand, but the sheer discrepancy in size is enough to make him scurry away. You try to insist it’s all okay, but they are just too worked up. But then, due to your distraction, Elena manages to pull her hand away from yours.

        <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"I’m sorry."<</Dialogue>>

        There it is, that sad melancholy that comes so naturally to her. It makes the kids stop for a moment, and it’s enough for you to take the reins of the situation. You assure the kids that everything is okay, and they look at you, incredulously - not doubting your sincerity, but the enormity of your physique. You tell them that you got this big and strong because you always ate your vegetables and drank all your milk, and that seems to make an impression on them, enough to completely disarm the situation. The group walks away, buzzing about how they’ll never again skip on their milk and veggies, and you turn your attention to Elena, who seems to be finally settling down. You give her a hug to make her feel better, and escort her out of the museum.


    <</if>>
    As you leave the shop, Elena thanks you for the intervention, which you just wave off as just something any friend will do. But she is quite adamant, a serious expression on her face, as she proclaims:

    <<Dialogue "Elena" "Elena">>"Grazie. I have no words. This… everything… sono in debito con te… I owe you."<</Dialogue>>

    You scoff at that comment, but she is dead serious. You clear your throat, and nod in agreement, trying to match her seriousness - but she just gives you a tight hug… and you hug her back. And with that, you say your goodbyes, and each of you go back to your own abodes.


<</if>>

As you make your way back home, you pull up your phone to look up the meaning of “mi fiore”.

It means “my flower”.

You bring the phone to your chest, pushing it tightly against it, as you let out a content sigh. It’s going to be a long walk home… or at the very least, it will feel that way.
